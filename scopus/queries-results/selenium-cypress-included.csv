A test automation framework based on WEB;Many software applications today are written as web-based applications to be run in an Internet browser. Selenium is a set of powerful different software tools working with many browsers, operating systems, programming languages, and testing frameworks each with a different approach to supporting automation test for testing web-based applications. JMeter is used to simulate a heavy load on a server, network or object to test its strength or to analyze overall performance under different load types. JMeter operates at the protocol-level, on the other hand, Selenium works at the user-level.In this paper, authors have designed an automatic software testing framework for web applications based on the Selenium and JMeter. With the use of the software framework, we efficiently improve the extensibility and reusability of automated test. The results show that the new software framework improves software products quality and develop efficiency. This paper also illustrates how to design web-based test automation framework in details. © 2012 IEEE.;Wang F., Du W.;2012;Proceedings - 2012 IEEE/ACIS 11th International Conference on Computer and Information Science, ICIS 2012;;;6211171;683;687;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84864061862&doi=10.1109%2fICIS.2012.21&partnerID=40&md5=db3463b79a5806afd910923a719ab986;"Automation testing framework; Jmeter; Selenium; Web";"Automated test; Automation testing; Heavy loads; Internet browsers; Jmeter; Load type; Software applications; Software frameworks; Software products; Test automation frameworks; Testing framework; Web; WEB application; Web-based applications; Computer programming; Information science; Internet protocols; Reusability; Selenium; Testing; Web services; Automation";
Mining executable specifications of web applications from Selenium IDE tests;A common practice for system testing of web-based applications is to perform the test cases through a web browser. These tests are often recorded and managed by a record and replay tool, such as Selenium IDE. Mining specifications from such tests can be very useful for understanding, verifying, and debugging the system under test. This paper presents an approach to mining a behavior specification from a Selenium IDE test suite such that (a) it captures the behavior of the tests at a high level of abstraction, (b) the behavior can be simulated, and (c) all the tests are completely reproducible from the specification. We first identify similar test actions through context-sensitive clustering so as to normalize the given Selenium IDE tests. Then, we mine patterns of test actions that represent meaningful functions and transform Selenium IDE tests into abstract tests, which are similar to the tests used in the existing model-mining techniques. From the abstract tests, we synthesize a high-level Petri net that captures both temporal constraints and data values. For evaluation purposes, we applied our approach to eight test suites of two real-world systems, Magento (an online shopping system being used by many live stores) and Amazon. Two of the test suites are for security testing, aiming at SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities. The result shows that our approach is effective in producing abstract yet executable specifications and reducing the complexity of the models. © 2012 IEEE.;Xu D., Xu W., Bavikati B.K., Wong W.E.;2012;Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE 6th International Conference on Software Security and Reliability, SERE 2012;;;6258316;263;272;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84866635438&doi=10.1109%2fSERE.2012.39&partnerID=40&md5=f65e90cd7b267e6d20b22b09222c0d3c;"Model-based testing; Petri nets; Software testing; Test mining; Web applications";"Behavior specifications; Context-sensitive; Data values; Executable specifications; High level of abstraction; Model based testing; On-line Shopping systems; Real-world system; Record-and-replay; Security testing; SQL injection; System testing; System under test; Temporal constraints; Test case; Test mining; WEB application; Web-based applications; Integrodifferential equations; Petri nets; Program debugging; Security of data; Selenium; Software reliability; Software testing; Specifications; World Wide Web; Testing";
Improving test data management in record and playback testing tools;It is almost impossible to prevent requirement change in the web development life cycle. Selenium despite being a widely used open source automated tool for testing web application, has its limitation when it concerns test data management. Frequent changes in requirement result in changes in the user interface which in turn requires additional effort to re-record the test script. Eventually keeping track of test data used for each test script becomes very problematic for the tester. In this paper, we analyse existing tools and provide a design of an automated testing tool, Kishanium that also manages the set of test data. A prototype was created during experimentation phase to prove the concept of the underlying ideas of the proposed tool. The prototype has been implemented based on the core technologies of DomDocument, XPath and Curl. The testing carried out proves that Kishanium is a useful automated tool that can be used on its own or in conjunction with Selenium. With a very systematic approach it automatically searches input and button objects, allows testers to add new test data, edit existing test data and delete previous test data in order to respond to frequent requirement changes. The power of Kishanium is that it is able to re-use existing test data even if there are a number of changes in the user interface. It also automatically runs the tests with the appropriate set of test data using its Poster Component. Moreover the Kishanium automated tool provides additional features such as Data generator, Spylink and Snapshot. © 2012 IEEE.;Nagowah L., Doorgah K.;2012;2012 International Conference on Computer and Information Science, ICCIS 2012 - A Conference of World Engineering, Science and Technology Congress, ESTCON 2012 - Conference Proceedings;2;;6297159;931;937;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84867852758&doi=10.1109%2fICCISci.2012.6297159&partnerID=40&md5=0c8175a24fc6f61180c430df08c9923d;"automated testing; record and playback problem; test data management";"Automated testing; Automated testing tools; Automated tools; Core technology; If there are; Open sources; Record and playback; Requirement change; Test data; Test data in; Test data management; Test scripts; Testing tools; WEB application; Web development; Automation; Information management; Information science; Selenium; Technology; User interfaces";
Browser level performance: Automation and best practices;The performance world has long been concerned with the speed and scalability of their IT infrastructure in relation to user experience. Traditional load testing applications all provide great benefits in testing and tuning your application infrastructure for optimal performance. However, with the emergence of web 2.0 and more interactive web applications, these traditional performance testing tools struggle to provide an accurate representation of your application's performance from the end-user's perspective. Client side performance is often a field which falls somewhere between the development, functional and performance organizations and is often neglected. This paper will present some best practices for ensuring better perceived application performance from the end users perspective, and an approach to using client side measurement tools in conjunction with the Selenium automation software to monitor and track your application's performance from the end-user's perspective.;Mazooji A., Kancharla M.R., Das A., Purushothaman B., Srinivasa L.N.;2013;Annual International Conference of the Computer Measurement Group, CMG 2013;2;;;1058;1069;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84899883440&partnerID=40&md5=96a5363822dd82e5251379e193fc1eaf;;"Application programs; Tools; World Wide Web; Application performance; Automation software; Interactive web applications; IT infrastructures; Measurement tools; Optimal performance; Performance testing; User experience; Measurements";Computer Measurement Group Inc
Capture-replay vs. programmable web testing: An empirical assessment during test case evolution;"There are several approaches for automated functional web testing and the choice among them depends on a number of factors, including the tools used for web testing and the costs associated with their adoption. In this paper, we present an empirical cost/benefit analysis of two different categories of automated functional web testing approaches: (1) capture-replay web testing (in particular, using Selenium IDE); and, (2) programmable web testing (using Selenium WebDriver). On a set of six web applications, we evaluated the costs of applying these testing approaches both when developing the initial test suites from scratch and when the test suites are maintained, upon the release of a new software version. Results indicate that, on the one hand, the development of the test suites is more expensive in terms of time required (between 32% and 112%) when the programmable web testing approach is adopted, but on the other hand, test suite maintenance is less expensive when this approach is used (with a saving between 16% and 51%). We found that, in the majority of the cases, after a small number of releases (from one to three), the cumulative cost of programmable web testing becomes lower than the cost involved with capture-replay web testing and the cost saving gets amplified over the successive releases. © 2013 IEEE.";Leotta M., Clerissi D., Ricca F., Tonella P.;2013;Proceedings - Working Conference on Reverse Engineering, WCRE;;;6671302;272;281;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84893430681&doi=10.1109%2fWCRE.2013.6671302&partnerID=40&md5=2b805d8ab73a03098f395051e37e5826;"Empirical Study; Selenium IDE; Selenium WebDriver; Test Case Evolution; Test Case Repair";"Application programs; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Integrodifferential equations; Reverse engineering; Selenium; Testing; Web crawler; Cumulative cost; Empirical assessment; Empirical studies; Number of factors; Software versions; Test case; Test case evolutions; WEB application; Software testing";IEEE Computer Society
Automated exploration and analysis of ajax web applications with webmole;WebMole is a browser-based tool that automatically and exhaustively explores all pages inside a web application. Contrarily to classical web crawlers, which only explore pages accessible through regular <a> anchors,WebMole can find its way through Ajax applications that use JavaScript-triggered links, and handles state changes that do not involve a page reload. User-defined functions called oracles can be used to bound the range of pages explored by WebMole to specific parts of an application, as well as to evaluate Boolean test conditions on all visited pages. Overall, WebMole can prove a more flexible alternative to automated testing suites such as Selenium WebDriver.;Le Breton G., Maronnaud F., Hallé S.;2013;WWW 2013 Companion - Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on World Wide Web;;;;245;248;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84893095379&doi=10.1145%2f2487788.2487913&partnerID=40&md5=a8ce1dfe2642a436069fa5aeac0ab258;"Navigation; Reverse engineering; Web applications";"Navigation; Reverse engineering; World Wide Web; Automated testing; Boolean tests; Javascript; User Defined Functions; WEB application; Web crawler";Association for Computing Machinery
Repairing selenium test cases: An industrial case study about web page element localization;This poster presents an industrial case study about test automation and test suite maintenance in the context of Web applications. The Web application under test is a Learning Content Management System (eXact learning LCMS). We analysed the costs associated with the realignment of four equivalent Selenium WebDriver test suites, implemented using the page object pattern and different methods to locate web page elements, to a subsequent release of eXact learning LCMS. In our study, the two ID-based test suites required significantly less maintenance effort than the XPath-based ones. © 2013 IEEE.;Leotta M., Clerissi D., Ricca F., Spadaro C.;2013;Proceedings - IEEE 6th International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation, ICST 2013;;;6569767;487;488;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84883318945&doi=10.1109%2fICST.2013.73&partnerID=40&md5=81111238132cdfd98b4ee2204d71eb24;"Selenium WebDriver; Test Automation; Test Suite Maintainability; Web Application Testing";"Exact learning; Industrial case study; Learning content management system; Maintenance efforts; Object patterns; Test Automation; WEB application; Web application testing; Industrial applications; Repair; Selenium; Software testing; Websites; Testing";
Improving test suites maintainability with the page object pattern: An industrial case study;The page object pattern is used in the context of web testing for abstracting the application's web pages in order to reduce the coupling between test cases and application under test. This paper reports on an industrial case study in a small Italian company (eXact learning solutions S.p.A.) investigating the potential benefits of adopting the page object pattern to improve the maintainability of Selenium Web Driver test cases. After a maintenance/evolution activity performed on the application under test, we compared two equivalent test suites, one built using the page object pattern and one without it. The results of our case study indicate a strong reduction in terms of time required (by a factor of about three) and number of modified LOCs (by a factor of about eight) to repair the test suite when the page object pattern is used. © 2013 IEEE.;Leotta M., Clerissi D., Ricca F., Spadaro C.;2013;Proceedings - IEEE 6th International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation Workshops, ICSTW 2013;;;6571616;108;113;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84883315834&doi=10.1109%2fICSTW.2013.19&partnerID=40&md5=3d9a669e8c5f8c18023f4d24972cd0fb;"Page Object Pattern; Selenium WebDriver; Test Automation; Test Suite Maintainability; Web Application Testing";"Application under tests; Exact learning; Industrial case study; Italian companies; Object patterns; Potential benefits; Test Automation; Web application testing; Industrial applications; Maintainability; Repair; Selenium; Software testing; Testing";
Extension of Selenium RC tool to perform automated testing with databases in web applications;This paper presents one extension of the Selenium RC tool to perform tests in web applications that require checking data in databases. This verification is performed using new functions implemented into the Selenium framework's core. These functions allow opening and closing database connection and comparing test data with data stored in the database used by the web application. This solution aims to contribute to the system quality by reducing the effort during the testing process, since the verification of UI and database elements will be performed at the same time during execution of the test scripts. A case study is described to analyze the impact of the proposed tool in terms of effort and rate of automation in the development of a new web application project. The results suggest a significant reduction (92% and 88%) in the effort to execute automated tests in database when compared to, respectively, manual and semiautomated execution. © 2013 IEEE.;De Castro A.M.F.V., Macedo G.A., Collins E.F., Dias-Neto A.C.;2013;2013 8th International Workshop on Automation of Software Test, AST 2013 - Proceedings;;;6595803;125;131;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84885001936&doi=10.1109%2fIWAST.2013.6595803&partnerID=40&md5=b0e6432b1c7ffe1c78f2d2e4495380ea;"Database Testing; Functional Testing; Selenium RC; Software Testing; Test Automation";"Automated test; Automated testing; Database connections; Database testing; Functional testing; Test Automation; Testing process; WEB application; Applications; Automation; Database systems; Selenium; Testing; Tools; World Wide Web; Software testing";
A Selenium based approach to automatic test script generation for refactoring JavaScript code;During the development process of Web application, two essential phases are software testing and code refactoring. However, automatic testing script plays an important role in test automation. It has been a hot research topic in Web application. In order to refactor the JavaScript code of Web application more conveniently, an approach to automatic script generation from the defined test case is introduced in this paper. First, it describes the test case using customized XML format. Then, since Selenium platform supports multi-browsers testing, a method to transform XML description into test scripts based on Selenium framework is proposed as the emphasis. © 2013 IEEE.;Chen R., Miao H.;2013;2013 IEEE/ACIS 12th International Conference on Computer and Information Science, ICIS 2013 - Proceedings;;;6607864;341;346;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84886493766&doi=10.1109%2fICIS.2013.6607864&partnerID=40&md5=502f84195429bfc17fe463e1f1919800;"JavaScript Refactoring; Selenium; The Framework of Script Automatic Generation; XML Schema";"Automatic Generation; Code re-factoring; Development process; Hot research topics; Refactorings; Script generation; XML description; XML schemas; Applications; Automatic testing; High level languages; Information science; Software testing; World Wide Web; XML; Selenium";
An approach to perform automated functional testing in database-driven applications;This paper presents an approach to performing automated functional testing in database-driven application. The goal is to provide test scripts that check contents in databases after CRUD (create, retrieval, update, and delete) operations using a software application. Based on automation tools already developed that test graphical user interface (GUI) elements, new assert functions were proposed and implemented to check data in databases. An instantiation of the proposed approach is described extending the Selenium RC tool to perform automated tests in web applications checking data stored in the database. A case study is described to analyze the impact of the proposed approach in terms of effort and rate of automation in the testing for a database-driven application. The results suggest a significant reduction (91% and 88%) in the effort to execute automated tests in database when compared to, respectively, manual and semi-automated execution.;de Castro A.M.F.V., Fontão A., Dias-Neto A.C.;2014;CIBSE 2014: Proceedings of the 17th Ibero-American Conference Software Engineering;;;;233;246;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84906056852&partnerID=40&md5=9caf27740388fc7413bb16b4792a9924;"Database testing; GUI testing; Software testing; Test automation";"Application programs; Automation; Graphical user interfaces; Software engineering; Software testing; Testing; Automated functional testing; Automation tools; Database testing; Graphical user interfaces (GUI); GUI testing; Software applications; Test Automation; WEB application; Database systems";Universidad de la Frontera
SAHI vs. Selenium: A comparative analysis;Functional testing for wireless based graphic user interfaces is one of the most routine and basic quality verification and validation on telecommunication products. These tests are often done based on requirements and specifications set and defined by product designers and original equipment manufacturers. As manual testing consumes considerable resource, having various time-to-market periods and user scenarios, automation is vital for testing. There are several tools that could perform automation, so we have conducted a study on two of the most commonly used web automation testing tools to allow test engineers and web and wireless software developers to make an informed decision on which tools to use based on their needs and resource. Which tool would give the best user experience? Which is easier to learn and maintain? Which tool needs lesser test resources and how convenient would the setup be for multiple iteration testing cycles?

Performance evaluation of web based automation testing tools;In today's 21st century era countless software applications are written as a web based application which runs in a web browsers. With new technologies and commercialization of I.T. sector, the web based system has undergoes frequent and rapid changes. Today Softwares are coded as a web based application, which help to access data from any part of the globe. Even the economic relevance of web based enhances the control and quality of software. The quality assurance of any system depends on its test. But to do manually testing in most of the cases is time consuming, expensive and hectic. For the better business purpose and to save time and money automation testing is required. There are variety of tools are available in the market for this. One of the best known tool is selenium suite which is a combination of different automation testing tool. In this paper we will discuss about the selenium suite. It provides testers with different framework for different test cases. The main objective of this paper is to find the best tool in selenium suite and then compare it with some other tool for same task. For this purpose, performance evaluation is done on the basis of some criteria. © 2014 IEEE.;Angmo R., Sharma M.;2014;Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Confluence 2014: The Next Generation Information Technology Summit;;;6949287;731;735;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84914141612&doi=10.1109%2fCONFLUENCE.2014.6949287&partnerID=40&md5=a5e9559eae1e4097423207a6e53cdaa9;"Automation testing; Performance; Selenium; Test case; Watir-webdriver; Web applications";"Application programs; Automation; Quality assurance; Quality control; Selenium; Web services; Websites; Automation testing; Performance; Test case; Watir-webdriver; WEB application; Web browsers";Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.
Prevalence and maintenance of automated functional tests for web applications;Functional testing requires executing particular sequences of user actions. Test automation tools enable scripting user actions such that they can be repeated more easily. SELENIUM, for instance, enables testing web applications through scripts that interact with a web browser and assert properties about its observable state. However, little is known about how common such tests are in practice. We therefore present a cross-sectional quantitative study of the prevalence of SELENIUM-based tests among open-source web applications, and of the extent to which such tests are used within individual applications. Automating functional tests also brings about the problem of maintaining test scripts. As the system under test evolves, its test scripts are bound to break. Even less is known about the way test scripts change over time. We therefore also present a longitudinal quantitative study of whether and for how long test scripts are maintained, as well as a longitudinal qualitative study of the kind of changes they undergo. To the former's end, we propose two new metrics based on whether a commit to the application's version repository touches a test file. To the latter's end, we propose to categorize the changes within each commit based on the elements of the test upon which they operate. As such, we are able to identify the elements of a test that are most prone to change. © 2014 IEEE.;Christophe L., Stevens R., De Roover C., De Meuter W.;2014;Proceedings - 30th International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution, ICSME 2014;;;6976080;141;150;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84931075925&doi=10.1109%2fICSME.2014.36&partnerID=40&md5=e635ef0a658ba87bddc1f443bdd500cd;"Functional testing; Selenium; Test automation";"Open source software; Selenium; Functional test; Functional testing; Qualitative study; Quantitative study; System under test; Test Automation; Test automation tool; WEB application; Automation";Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.
Analysis and design of selenium webdriver automation testing framework;Nowadays, number of software system has been implemented as web-based applications. These web applications are very complex. It is very difficult to test such complex web applications. Automation testing uses automation tools to reduce human intervention and repeatable tasks. In this paper we have designed and implemented automation testing framework for testing web applications. This new automation testing framework has been implemented using selenium WebDriver tool. Using this framework tester can easily write their test cases efficiently and in less time. Tester need not to study the selenium webdriver tool in detail. This framework is helpful to developer to analyze their code due to screen shot property of framework. This framework produces the customized test report to tester. It is very easy to maintain and repair the test suite for new release of the application using this framework. © 2015 The Authors.

Keyword driven automated testing framework for web application;Presently in software testing companies, 90% of software testing is carried out manually which takes lots of time, and also need large number of employees which not only increase the cost of the Software but also takes more time for completion. Therefore, software testing companies are moving towards automated testing and there is a need to develop a testing framework which is application independent and scalable with the increased requirements of each application. An automated testing framework has been proposed here for testing web applications. The proposed framework is based on keyword driven framework in which a excel file containing the keywords is imported to the framework by using selenium WebDriver API. © 2014 IEEE.;Aiya K.V., Verma H.;2015;9th International Conference on Industrial and Information Systems, ICIIS 2014;;;7036478;;;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84924280658&doi=10.1109%2fICIINFS.2014.7036478&partnerID=40&md5=996e8b7f051394c3449fa2c93a700473;"Automated testing framework; Keyword driven framework; Selenium WebDriver; Software testing";"Application programs; Automation; Automated testing; Keyword driven; Testing framework; WEB application; Software testing";Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.
Using free and open source tools to manage software quality;Experts share their views on the use of free and open source tools to manage software quality. One of the first tasks for a project team is to set up a source code control framework. It is critical to maintain a central area for the team to check in code and have it backed up regularly. The tests are executed in Firefox and recorded via the Selenium IDE. The tests are then saved on the server side. A single file to list all the individual test cases to be executed as part of a test suite is created.;Dowling P., McGrath K.;2015;Communications of the ACM;58;7;;51;55;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84934765947&doi=10.1145%2f2755503&partnerID=40&md5=d092494d4a86daf9556fdde79bac51f0;;"Computer software selection and evaluation; Open systems; Check-in; Control framework; Open source tools; Project team; Server sides; Software Quality; Source codes; Test case; Open source software";Association for Computing Machinery

Semantics-based automated web testing;We present TAO, a software testing tool performing automated test and oracle generation based on a semantic approach. TAO entangles grammar-based test generation with automated semantics evaluation using a denotational semantics framework. We show how TAO can be incorporated with the Selenium automation tool for automated web testing, and how TAO can be further extended to support automated delta debugging, where a failing web test script can be systematically reduced based on grammar-directed strategies. A real-life parking website is adopted throughout the paper to demonstrate the effectivity of our semantics-based web testing approach.;Guo H.-F., Ouyang Q., Siy H.;2015;Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science, EPTCS;188;;;59;74;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84954484246&doi=10.4204%2fEPTCS.188.7&partnerID=40&md5=a9d3504438f294b3207f6c4603f13890;;"Automation; Semantics; Software testing; Specifications; Websites; World Wide Web; Automated test; Automation tools; Delta debugging; Denotational semantics; Semantic approach; Test generations; Test scripts; Web testing; Semantic Web";Open Publishing Association
Highly automated agile testing process: An industrial case study;This paper presents a description of an agile testing process in a medium size software project that is developed using Scrum. The research methods used is the case study were as follows: surveys, quantifiable project data sources and qualitative project members opinions were used for data collection. Challenges related to the testing process regarding a complex project environment and unscheduled releases were identified. Based on the obtained results, we concluded that the described approach addresses well the aforementioned issues. Therefore, recommendations were made with regard to the employed principles of agility, specifically: continuous integration, responding to change, test automation and test driven development. Furthermore, an efficient testing environment that combines a number of test frameworks (e.g. JUnit, Selenium, Jersey Test) with custom-developed simulators is presented.;Berłowski J., Chrusciel P., Kasprzyk M., Konaniec I., Jureczko M.;2016;E-Informatica Software Engineering Journal;10;1;;69;87;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84994060568&doi=10.5277%2fe-Inf160104&partnerID=40&md5=083f94f0e5d8fb8f59cb63053f34124c;"Agile software development; Case study; Software engineering; Testing process";"Software design; Software engineering; Agile software development; Complex projects; Continuous integrations; Industrial case study; Software project; Test driven development; Testing environment; Testing process; Software testing";Politechnika Wroclawska
On building test automation system for mobile applications using GUI ripping;With the rapid advance of mobile computing technology and wireless networking, there is a significant increase of mobile subscriptions. This brings new business requirements and demands in mobile software testing, and causes new issues and challenges in mobile testing and automation. Current existing mobile application testing tools mostly concentrate on GUI, load and performance testing which seldom consider large-scale concurrent automation, coverage analysis, fault tolerance and usage of well-defined models. This paper introduces an implemented system that provides an automation solution across platforms on diverse devices using GUI ripping test scripting technique. Through incorporating open source technologies such as Appium and Selenium Grid, this paper addresses the scalable test automation control with the capability of fault tolerant. Additionally, maximum test coverage can also be obtained by executing parallel test scripts within the model. Finally, the paper reports case studies to indicate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.;Tao C., Gao J.;2016;Proceedings of the International Conference on Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering, SEKE;2016-January;;;480;485;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84988358022&doi=10.18293%2fSEKE2016-168&partnerID=40&md5=00aed5e24fdf96cee6de18b3ede0dc8f;"GUI ripping; Large-scale concurrent testing; Mobile application testing; Test automation";"Automation; Fault tolerance; Graphical user interfaces; Knowledge engineering; Load testing; Mobile computing; Mobile telecommunication systems; Open source software; Software engineering; Automation solutions; Business requirement; Concurrent testing; Issues and challenges; Mobile application testing; Mobile computing technology; Open-source technology; Test Automation; Software testing";Knowledge Systems Institute Graduate School
End to end specification based test generation of web applications;Using formal specifications to generate test cases presents great potential for automation in testing and enhancing the quality of test cases. However, an important challenge in this direction is the design specifications which are at a more abstract level than the implementation, with many important implementation level details missing. To generate executable test cases, these implementation details must be included at some stage. Though there has been a lot of work in test generation from specification, all the existing methods suffer from this problem: either the test cases are not executable, or the process involves a non-trivial, manual step of translating the abstract test cases to concrete test cases. In this work, we present an approach of specification based test generation for web applications that overcomes the above challenge: test generation is completely automated and the test cases are fully executable on a test execution framework (e.g. Selenium RC). Further, our methodology allows generation of multiple sets of concrete test cases from the the same formal specification. This makes it possible to use the same abstract specification to generate test cases for a number of versions of the system. Throughout the paper, a case study of Learning Management System is used to illustrate our approach. Copyright © 2016 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

ACT (Abstract to Concrete Tests) - A tool for generating Concrete test cases from Formal Specification of Web Applications;As web applications are becoming more and more ubiquitous, modeling and testing web applications correctly is becoming necessary. In this paper, we have used a formal specification language, State chart to model the navigation behaviour aspect of web applications. This paper presents the ACT (Abstract to Concrete Tests) tool, an approach of generating concrete executable Selenium RC JUnit test cases from a formal State chart specification model. The ACT tool can generate concrete Selenium RC JUnit test cases from abstract test cases by utilizing data shared across different interactions of the web application with the web server.

Survey on selenium tool in software testing;We are moving towards a general public where web is the need of hour. Today the vast majority of the product applications executed, are composed as online applications which are keep running in a web program. Testing programming applications is critical. Numerous associations make utilization of a specific web application, so the same web applications are tried habitually by diverse clients from distinctive regions physically. Testing a web application physically is tedious, so we go for test automation. In test automation we make utilization of a product device to run repeatable tests against the application to be tried. There are various focal points of test automation. They are exceptionally exact and have more prominent preparing pace when contrasted with manual automation. There are various open source and business devices accessible for test mechanization. Selenium is one of the broadly utilized open source device for test computerization. Test automation enhances the effectiveness of programming testing procedures. Test automation gives quick criticism to engineers. It additionally discovers the imperfections when one may miss in the manual testing. In test automation we can perform boundless emphases for testing the same example of code ceaselessly commonly. © 2015 IEEE.;Altaf I., Dar J.A., Rashid F.U., Rafiq M.;2016;Proceedings of the 2015 International Conference on Green Computing and Internet of Things, ICGCIoT 2015;;;7380682;1378;1383;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84966671563&doi=10.1109%2fICGCIoT.2015.7380682&partnerID=40&md5=6a2c1f3efd058cd26c18c6f10a5d4c27;"aka.selenium; RC; selenium; selenium control; selenium grid; selenium ide; test case; web driver";"Application programs; Automation; Internet; Internet of things; Machinery; Open source software; Selenium; Testing; World Wide Web; aka.selenium; General publics; On-line applications; Product applications; Test Automation; Test case; Testing procedure; web driver; Software testing";Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.
Robula+: An algorithm for generating robust XPath locators for web testing;Automated test scripts are used with success in many web development projects, so as to automatically verify key functionalities of the web application under test, reveal possible regressions and run a large number of tests in short time. However, the adoption of automated web testing brings advantages but also novel problems, among which the test code fragility problem. During the evolution of the web application, existing test code may easily break and testers have to correct it. In the context of automated DOM-based web testing, one of the major costs for evolving the test code is the manual effort necessary to repair broken web page element locators - lines of source code identifying the web elements (e.g. form fields and buttons) to interact with. In this work, we present Robula+, a novel algorithm able to generate robust XPath-based locators - locators that are likely to work correctly on new releases of the web application. We compared Robula+ with several state of the practice/art XPath locator generator tools/algorithms. Results show that XPath locators produced by Robula+ are by far the most robust. Indeed, Robula+ reduces the locators' fragility on average by 90% w.r.t. absolute locators and by 63% w.r.t. Selenium IDE locators.

A semantic approach for automated test oracle generation;"This paper presents the design, implementation, and applications of a software testing tool, TAO, which allows users to specify and generate test cases and oracles in a declarative way. Extended from its previous grammar-based test generation tool, TAO provides a declarative notation for defining denotational semantics on each productive grammar rule, such that when a test case is generated, its expected semantics will be evaluated automatically as well, serving as its test oracle. TAO further provides a simple tagging mechanism to embed oracles into test cases for bridging the automation between test case generation and software testing. Two practical case studies are used to illustrate how automated oracle generation can be effectively integrated with grammar-based test generation in different testing scenarios: locating fault-inducing input patterns on Java applications; and Selenium-based automated web testing. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd";Guo H.-F.;2016;Computer Languages, Systems and Structures;45;;;204;219;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84959311954&doi=10.1016%2fj.cl.2016.01.006&partnerID=40&md5=63d0580f3acd8ffcd68a6e1ebc3e66d0;"Denotational semantics; Software testing; Test case generation; Test oracle";"Application programs; Automatic test pattern generation; Automation; Semantics; Automated test; Denotational semantics; Input patterns; Java applications; Semantic approach; Test case generation; Test generations; Test oracles; Software testing";Elsevier Ltd
SmartDriver: Extension of selenium webdriver to create more efficient automated tests;The SmartDriver framework is an open extension of Selenium WebDriver framework aimed at decreasing implementation and maintenance costs of automated tests. It composes from two principal modules working in synergy. The structuring module ensuring three layer architecture of reusable objects, page objects and tests. Besides decreasing of implementation and maintenance costs, this module allows to create tests which can be easily read by testers or business analysts without previous extensive programming knowledge. The maintenance module then decreases time needed to update the scripts. When a test fails when locating a page element which does not exist due to obsolete test script, SmartDriver automatically analyzes if the element has been just moved to another place in the page. If so, it gives this information to the script developer. © 2016 IEEE.;Bures M., Filipsky M.;2016;2016 6th International Conference on IT Convergence and Security, ICITCS 2016;;;7740370;;;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85006320716&doi=10.1109%2fICITCS.2016.7740370&partnerID=40&md5=9e94ebf40b55ffe6fe1d6637171abe6e;"Architecture; Maintenance; Mobile testing; Selenium WebDriver; Test automation; Test automation framework; Web application testing";"Architecture; Automation; Computer software reusability; Maintenance; Selenium; Business analysts; Maintenance cost; Mobile testing; Programming knowledge; Test Automation; Test automation frameworks; Threelayer architecture; Web application testing; Testing";Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.
Segen: Generation of test cases for selenium and selendroid;Nowadays, with the rise of mobile devices, users deal with applications that present user interfaces adapted to different contexts of use. In order to improve the quality of these user interfaces, we propose a solution that includes a higher level description of tests and a tool, called Segen, for generating test cases for two very known test automation tools for Web and mobile environments: Selenium and Selendroid. Segen allows to generate test scripts from a single high-level description to executable tests scripts for each environment. On using Segen, testers can focus on the test cases, independently of the environment being used. A proof of concept was used to evaluate Segen: A smart home energy management that has a Web version and a mobile Android version. The evaluation showed that Segen reduces the work of testers and can be used along with other testing libraries. The evaluation also showed that Segen is more useful if test cases are designed before the development. However, it was identified that Segen has similar limitations to those that Selenium and Selendroid have. © 2016 ACM.;Neto N.M.L., Vilain P., Dos Santos Mello R.;2016;ACM International Conference Proceeding Series;;;;433;442;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014937121&doi=10.1145%2f3011141.3011154&partnerID=40&md5=dc2a22417d60e5180a4c6f8bc87b1bc4;"Segen; Selendroid; Selenium; Software testing; Tobias; User interface testing";"Automation; Information analysis; Information retrieval; Intelligent buildings; Selenium; Software testing; Testing; Web services; Websites; High level description; Interface testings; Mobile environments; Proof of concept; Segen; Selendroid; Test automation tool; Tobias; User interfaces";Association for Computing Machinery
Case study on testing of web-based application: Del's students information system;Software Testing is an important process to assure the quality of software including web-based application. The aim of testing is to detect all failures to ensure that the software is built in accordance with its specifications. There are two methods of testing, such as the white box and the black box testing. White box testing is done with the approach to the program code, while black box testing is done without referring to the source code, but to the output of the resulting program. User interface testing is the type of testing that is usually conducted on a web-based application. In this research, functional and user interface testing were conducted into Del's Student Information System. Testing techniques used in this research was a Simple Functional Acceptance Test (FAST). This technique was done by testing each function and checking each component of the user interface. Selenium IDE was used to execute test cases resulting in the implementation. From all steps carried out in this research, it can be concluded that the functional testing can be carried out in line with the testing of the user interface. A testing scenario for web-based application has been proposed and experimentally applied into an application under testing.;Sinaga A.M.;2017;Journal of Telecommunication, Electronic and Computer Engineering;9;04.lut;;1;5;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032960670&partnerID=40&md5=83f6950824eccfbd598256802d17fd3c;"Functional Acceptance Simple Test (FAST); Functional testing; UI testing; Web testing";;Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka
Accelerating Test Automation through a Domain Specific Language;Test automation involves the automatic execution of test scripts instead of being manually run. This significantly reduces the amount of manual effort needed and thus is of great interest to the software testing industry. There are two key problems in the existing tools & methods for test automation - a) Creating an automation test script is essentially a code development task, which most testers are not trained on, and b) the automation test script is seldom readable, making the task of maintenance an effort intensive process. We present the Accelerating Test Automation Platform (ATAP) which is aimed at making test automation accessible to non-programmers. ATAP allows the creation of an automation test script through a domain specific language based on English. The English-like test scripts are automatically converted to machine executable code using Selenium WebDriver. ATAP's English-like test script makes it easy for non-programmers to author. The functional flow of an ATAP script is easy to understand as well thus making maintenance simpler (you can understand the flow of the test script when you revisit it many months later). ATAP has been built around the Eclipse ecosystem and has been used in a real-life testing project. We present the details of the implementation of ATAP and the results from its usage in practice. © 2017 IEEE.;Dwarakanath A., Era D., Priyadarshi A., Dubash N., Podder S.;2017;Proceedings - 10th IEEE International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation, ICST 2017;;;7928002;460;467;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020725176&doi=10.1109%2fICST.2017.52&partnerID=40&md5=bed062f356959826d87cff3e1eaea7b3;"DSL; Selenium; Test automation; Xtext";"Automation; Computer programming languages; DSL; Problem oriented languages; Selenium; Verification; Automation tests; Code development; Domain specific languages; Executable codes; Functional flow; Real-life testing; Test Automation; Xtext; Software testing";Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.
Automatically locating unnamed windows and inner frames for web regression testing;Selenium IDE is a glorious state-of-The-Art integrated development environment for recording and playing Selenium test cases for web testing. However, it does not support automatically locating unnamed popup windows and inner frames, which impedes creating a sequence of test commands across different windows and inner frames.

APOGEN: automatic page object generator for web testing;Modern web applications are characterized by ultra-rapid development cycles, and web testers tend to pay scant attention to the quality of their automated end-to-end test suites. Indeed, these quickly become hard to maintain, as the application under test evolves. As a result, end-to-end automated test suites are abandoned, despite their great potential for catching regressions. The use of the Page Object pattern has proven to be very effective in end-to-end web testing. Page objects are façade classes abstracting the internals of web pages into high-level business functions that can be invoked by the test cases. By decoupling test code from web page details, web test cases are more readable and maintainable. However, the manual development of such page objects requires substantial coding effort, which is paid off only later, during software evolution. In this paper, we describe a novel approach for the automatic generation of page objects for web applications. Our approach is implemented in the tool Apogen, which automatically derives a testing model by reverse engineering the target web application. It combines clustering and static analysis to identify meaningful page abstractions that are automatically turned into Java page objects for Selenium WebDriver. Our evaluation on an open-source web application shows that our approach is highly promising: Automatically generated page object methods cover most of the application functionalities and result in readable and meaningful code, which can be very useful to support the creation of more maintainable web test suites. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.;Stocco A., Leotta M., Ricca F., Tonella P.;2017;Software Quality Journal;25;3;;1007;1039;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84981289299&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-016-9331-9&partnerID=40&md5=5504a841c8b9227978e9cd8cd9e9a61d;"Clustering; End-to-end testing; Page object pattern; Reverse engineering; Selenium WebDriver; Web testing";"Abstracting; Codes (symbols); Open source software; Open systems; Reverse engineering; Selenium; Static analysis; Websites; World Wide Web; Application under tests; Automatic Generation; Automatically generated; Business functions; Clustering; End to end; Object patterns; Web testing; Automatic test pattern generation";Springer New York LLC

Testing using selenium web driver;Software testing is considered to be the most important step in Software Development Life Cycle. The main objective of the testing process is to compare the obtained results with those of expected by the end user of the software. Test Automation simplifies the work of tester by automating the execution of test scripts with the use of a special software.

Evaluating the user acceptance testing for multi-tenant cloud applications;SaaS (Software as a Service) is a service delivery model in which an application can be provided on demand via the Internet. Multi-tenant architecture is essential for SaaS because it enables multiple customers, so-called tenants, to share the system's resources in a transparent way to reduce costs and customize the software layer, resulting in variant applications. Despite the popularity of this model, there have been few cases of evaluation of software testing in cloud computing. Many researchers argue that traditional software testing may not be a suitable way of validating cloud applications owing to the high degree of customization, its dynamic environment and multi-tenancy. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) evaluates the external quality of a product and complements previous testing activities. The main focus of this paper is on investigating the ability of the parallel and automated UAT to detect faults with regard to the number of tenants. Thus, our aim is to evaluate to what extent the ability to detect faults varies if a different number of variant applications is executed. A case study was designed with a multi-tenant application called iCardapio and a testing framework created through Selenium and JUnit extensions. The results showed a significant difference in terms of detected faults when test scenarios with a single-tenant and multi-tenant were included.

Methodology for regression testing with open source tool;"The paper describes our methodology for optimizing regression testing that forms a major part of software maintenance. It necessitates the use of an automated testing tool, and we have selected Selenium, an open source tool. For simple projects, a formula is proposed that has been derived through data mining with Selenium. A genetic algorithm is added to this methodology for industry based projects, where the test cases are so large that they have to be grouped as Test Suites; this algorithm reconfigures Test suites in each cycle of regression testing.

Automating Web Application Testing from the Ground Up: Experiences and Lessons Learned in an Industrial Setting;Automating web application testing is a very tricky process due to inherent complexity, dynamic behavior(s) in web pages, differences in the way browsers render the same content (especially on different form factors), and so on. Yet manual testing is not a practical option, and such automation is a must in the interests of effectiveness and efficiency, because of the large number of browsers/devices that users can choose from, and also given the rapid software development cycles of today. This paper discusses our efforts at Varidesk to automate web tests against our main website-which offers many features and content, but is also a true eCommerce site where users from around the globe can purchase a very broad variety of active workspace solutions that we offer. Our solution was developed in-house, from the ground up, and leveraged and extended freely available automation and test libraries such as Selenium WebDriver and NUnit respectively. We talk about the challenges we faced and how we overcame them, as well as provide technical insights on real-world concerns such as managing test brittleness, and integrating the web tests into an existing Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. Part of the novelty of this paper is that we are also transparent on the rationale behind our decision to build versus buy, and how we managed resources, especially in terms of cost. We also present lessons learned, and encouraged by the success that we have observed, hope that the results will be beneficial to academia and practitioners alike. © 2018 IEEE.;Debroy V., Brimble L., Yost M., Erry A.;2018;Proceedings - 2018 IEEE 11th International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation, ICST 2018;;;;354;362;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048453978&doi=10.1109%2fICST.2018.00042&partnerID=40&md5=ec31fbfde0ac7dd7dbeed5636d1bc145;"automation; industry experience; web application testing; web testing";"Automation; Digital libraries; Fracture mechanics; Software design; Verification; Websites; Continuous integrations; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Industrial settings; Industry experience; Inherent complexity; Software development cycles; Web application testing; Web testing; Software testing";Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.
Poster: Testingweb-based applications with the voice controlled accessibility and testing tool (VCAT);Many web applications and software engineering tools such as test generators are not accessible for users who do not use traditional input devices such as mouse and keyboard. To address this shortcoming of current applications, this work leverages recent speech recognition advances to create a browser plugin that interprets voice inputs as web browser commands and as steps in a corresponding test case. In an initial experiment, the resulting Voice Controlled Accessibility and Testing tool (VCAT) prototype for Chrome and Selenium yielded a lower overall runtime than a traditional test creation approach. © 2018 Authors.;Ramachandra N.P.K., Csallner C.;2018;Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering;;;;208;209;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049679194&doi=10.1145%2f3183440.3195099&partnerID=40&md5=bbfb5afa422cb479ef341da874d8720b;"Accessible software engineering tool; Selenium; Voice control";"Application programs; Selenium; Speech recognition; Input devices; Plug-ins; Software engineering tools; Test case; Testing tools; Voice control; Voice-controlled; WEB application; Software testing";IEEE Computer Society
Journal first presentation of an experience report on applying software testing academic results in industry: We need usable automated test generation;"What is the impact of software engineering research on current practices in industry? In this paper, I report on my direct experience as a PhD/post-doc working in software engineering research projects, and then spending the following five years as an engineer in two different companies (the first one being the same I worked in collaboration with during my post-doc). Given a background in software engineering research, what cutting-edge techniques and tools from academia did I use in my daily work when developing and testing the systems of these companies? Regarding validation and verification (my main area of research), the answer is rather short: as far as I can tell, only FindBugs. In this paper, I report on why this was the case, and discuss all the challenging, complex open problems we face in industry and which somehow are ""neglected"" in the academic circles. In particular, I will first discuss what actual tools I could use in my daily work, such as JaCoCo and Selenium. Then, I will discuss the main open problems I faced, particularly related to environment simulators, unit and web testing. After that, popular topics in academia are presented, such as UML, regression and mutation testing. Their lack of impact on the type of projects I worked on in industry is then discussed. Finally, from this industrial experience, I provide my opinions about how this situation can be improved, in particular related to how academics are evaluated, and advocate for a greater involvement into open-source projects. © 2018 Author.";Arcuri A.;2018;Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering;;;;1065;;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049395546&doi=10.1145%2f3180155.3182555&partnerID=40&md5=0ea22b06313dc6b9844a6955740d3c31;"Applied research; Impact; Industry; Practice; Technology transfer";"Cutting tools; Industry; Open source software; Software testing; Technology transfer; Applied research; Automated test generations; Environment simulators; Impact; Industrial experience; Open source projects; Practice; Validation and verification; Engineering research";IEEE Computer Society
Pesto: Automated migration of DOM-based Web tests towards the visual approach;"Test automation tools are widely adopted for testing complex Web applications. Three generations of tools exist: first, based on screen coordinates; second, based on DOM–based commands; and third, based on visual image recognition. In our previous work, we proposed Pesto, a tool able to migrate second-generation Selenium WebDriver test suites towards third-generation Sikuli ones. In this work, we extend Pesto to manage Web elements having (1) complex visual interactions and (2) multiple visual appearances. Pesto relies on aspect-oriented programming, computer vision, and code transformations. Our new improved tool has been evaluated on two Web test suites developed by an independent tester. Experimental results show that Pesto manages and transforms correctly test suites with Web elements having complex visual interactions and multistate elements. By using Pesto, the migration of existing DOM–based test suites to the visual approach requires a low manual effort, since our approach proved to be very accurate.

Test Command Auto-Wait Mechanisms for Record and Playback-Style Web Application Testing;Test case recording and playback technology, normally implemented as a test case recorder, has been widely applied in the industry. One of the key research topics is how to determine if a web page has entered a ready state before the recorder can perform the next test command? If a web element is incorrectly selected during playback, the related test command will fail to process. This research puts forward four kinds of automatic waiting mechanism for playing test commands. The experiment result shows that the waiting time can be determined dynamically and automatically, so that testers do not have to manually add waiting commands thereby reducing the time and error of artificial discrimination. The proposed mechanisms were implemented as parts of the SideeX open source web testing software and have been further adopted by the new Selenium IDE and Katalon Recorder. Currently, over 60,000 web testers around the world run the mechanisms. © 2018 IEEE.;Lee S.-J., Chen Y.-X., Ma S.-P., Lee W.-T.;2018;Proceedings - International Computer Software and Applications Conference;2;;8377833;75;80;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055470126&doi=10.1109%2fCOMPSAC.2018.10206&partnerID=40&md5=c397ab858cf7cd11ae45acbf4f214b09;"Automated web application testing; Automatic-wait; Test case recording and playback";"Application programs; Open source software; Open systems; Websites; Automatic-wait; Open sources; Record and playback; Research topics; Test case; Waiting-time; Web application testing; Web testing; Software testing";IEEE Computer Society
Fighting unemployment through java internships: Creating a path to software development through test automation;The unemployment rate in South Africa for first quarter 2017 was just under thirty percent. To help alleviate this problem, the South African Revenue Service offers certain tax incentives to companies which operate internships or in-service training to under-skilled individuals. At the same time of this high unemployment rate, there is a shortage of certain IT skills in the country including a shortage of Java programmers. This paper describes research in offering internships to people who hold some sort of documented proof of computer literacy such as the ICDL and training them to write test automation programs in Java. The internship creates a pathway from test automation to entry level Java programmer. This paper describes two iterations of the process and documents the training offered to the interns, the successes and the lessons learned. In the second iteration (and the final iteration described in this paper), interns learned Java programming by writing test program in Java using Sikulix (to test Java application), Selenium (to test websites) and Robotium (to test Android apps). The results are very positive. © 2018 IST-Africa Institute.;Butgereit L.;2018;2018 IST-Africa Week Conference, IST-Africa 2018;;;8417368;;;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051238765&partnerID=40&md5=fb9f18718d9c8dabd4a43bb325aaa6e7;"in-service training; internship; software development; test automation";"Application programs; Automation; Employment; Graphical user interfaces; Population statistics; Software design; Software engineering; Software testing; Taxation; Computer literacy; In-service training; internship; Java applications; Java programmers; Java programming; Test Automation; Unemployment rates; Java programming language";Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.

A Study of Software Testing Practices in Sri Lankan Software Companies;Software testing is a knowledge intensive and a collaborative activity, which mainly depends on knowledge and experience of the software testers. This study presents using an empirical investigation carried out in Sri Lankan software companies about the current status of software testing practices. The study focused on mainly testing methodologies and techniques, automated tools, testing metrics, testing training and academic collaboration with software industry. As reported from this study, Agile methodology became very popular in software companies for software development. As an overall analysis, there was a great interest in using tools such as Selenium for testing activities. Findings of this study emphasized that while software testing practices were considered to be important, training, money and resources were inadequate to address an effective management of software testing knowledge in these three software companies. Findings also presented a compelling evidence of the soundness for the need of knowledge management practices to manage software testing knowledge, © 2018 IEEE.;Vasanthapriyan S.;2018;Proceedings - 2018 IEEE 18th International Conference on Software Quality, Reliability, and Security Companion, QRS-C 2018;;;8431994;339;344;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85052497779&doi=10.1109%2fQRS-C.2018.00066&partnerID=40&md5=005f87cd6797fdcbadaa4f92929c6cd0;"Software testing; Software testing knowledge; Testing practices";"C (programming language); Computer software selection and evaluation; Knowledge management; Software design; Software reliability; Agile Methodologies; Collaborative activities; Effective management; Empirical investigation; Knowledge and experience; Knowledge intensives; Knowledge management practices; Testing knowledge; Software testing";Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.
Extending WebDriver: A cloud approach;Functional testing of web and mobile applications consists on impersonating a user through some kind of GUI automation technology, being Selenium the most popular solution nowadays. This piece of research progresses in this area by proposing an advanced User Impersonation as a Service (UIaaS) based on cloud technologies. The proposed approach can be seen as a layered service, in which the top tier is a platform called ElasTest, a Software as a Service (SaaS) testing tool aimed to ease end-to-end testing of different kind of applications. The capability to impersonate user provided by ElasTest is built on the top of a Platform as a Service (PaaS) implemented by extending the W3C WebDriver recommendation with advance features to assess web and mobile applications. Finally, an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) layer is used as ground technology. This infrastructure has been implemented by leveraging open source lightweight container technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes. © 2018 IEEE.;Garcia B., Gallego M., Santos C., Jimenez E., Leal K., Fernanez L.;2018;Proceedings - 2018 International Conference on the Quality of Information and Communications Technology, QUATIC 2018;;;8590182;143;146;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061321044&doi=10.1109%2fQUATIC.2018.00029&partnerID=40&md5=b8b832a9180c764d6c6860464ca1f60f;"Infrastructure as a Service; Platform as a Service; Software as a Service; Software testing; WebDriver";"Application programs; Mobile computing; Open source software; Platform as a Service (PaaS); Software as a service (SaaS); Software testing; Web services; Automation technology; Cloud technologies; End to end; Functional testing; Mobile applications; Open sources; Testing tools; WebDriver; Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)";Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.
An Approach of Automated Testing on Web Based Platform Using Machine Learning and Selenium;Testing is performed to detect or discover the errors and defects of a system. In automated testing, what test cases tester shown only will tested. It will not test new link or new thing but here what we are trying anything is new it can understand from previous experience and try to apply experience to get new results. This approach can be achieved by a three-layer structure: Web scraper, Machine Learning (ML) and Selenium. Web page would be tested and it would be trained to a system from a human perceptive in such a way that the system able to understand what are the test cases that need to be followed for each and every element on the web page and system next time on wards will do sanity and smoke test based on those inputs intelligently going to those elements on the website. System learns what actions to be done for a particular web element like button. The outputs that are able to get it is even classified the kind of output, for example, is error page or is the page is not intended. This approach helps the larger business organization to align themselves more with a creative task in testing rather than doing the human repeated activity. © 2018 IEEE.;Paul N., Tommy R.;2018;Proceedings of the International Conference on Inventive Research in Computing Applications, ICIRCA 2018;;;8597297;851;856;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061509533&doi=10.1109%2fICIRCA.2018.8597297&partnerID=40&md5=aaaa73e3e74ab673dfa34a2da07a8387;"Automated Testing; Machine Learning; Selenium Web Driver; Test Case; Web Applications";"Automation; E-learning; Learning systems; Machine learning; Selenium; Smoke; Testing; Automated testing; Business organizations; New results; Smoke test; Test case; Three-layer structures; WEB application; Web based platform; Websites";Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.
X-Brot: Prototyping of compatibility testing tool for web application based on document analysis technology;Web application development requires visual compatibility testing (VCT), which verifies if a web page is normally displayed on different types of browsers. In common development procedures, VCT is carried out manually. To reduce cost, VCT automation is one of the most important issues in the field of software development. Although a web page is a kind of electronic document, there have not been many papers focusing on VCT issues in the document analysis and recognition (DAR) field. We have developed a prototype tool to support web application testing. The tool offers two tests: a functional compatibility test (FCT) and a VCT. The FCT examines whether the same action (such as click, browse, or text edit) on a web page causes a compatible action on each browser, and the VCT examines whether the same page displays a similar view on each browser. To detect visual incompatibilities, our tool first extracts the document object model (DOM) structure of a target web page by parsing HTML and obtaining properties of each DOM element from the browsers using the Selenium WebDriver tool [1]. The tool compares the relative position of the DOM elements on the web page and their contents. Our tool detects the differences in relative position of each DOM element and creates cliques of those whose relative positions are qualified as equal. The cliques show distortions in the document layout. Additionally, our tool identifies text images of each DOM element and compares the results between the browsers by looking for garbled characters. In fifteen URLs and four web browsers, we obtained 96% recall and 68% precision for text comparison, and 96% recall and 61% precision for detecting layout incompatibilities. A small pilot study shows that operation time of a web application testing task was reduced by almost 35% using our tool. This study indicates that our tool is effective in reducing the development cost of web applications. © 2019 IEEE.;Tanaka H.;2019;2019 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition Workshops, ICDARW 2019;2019-January;;;18;21;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114887222&doi=10.1109%2fICDARW.2019.60126&partnerID=40&md5=09bccd67dbb14269808ab8b9d17c5910;"Character recognition; Clique; DOM; HTML; Relative position; Selenium; Web browser; WebDriver";"Cost reduction; Software design; Software prototyping; Websites; XML; Compatibility test; Development costs; Document analysis; Document object model; Electronic document; Relative positions; Web application development; Web application testing; Web browsers";Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.
Recommending correct locator for broken test scripts using various clues in web application;Test automation tools such as Selenium are commonly used for automating end-to-end tests, but when developers update the software, they often need to modify the test scripts accordingly. However, the costs of modifying these test scripts are a big obstacle to test automation because of the scripts' fragility. In particular, locators in test scripts are prone to change. Some prior methods tried to repair broken locators by using structural clues, but these approaches usually cannot handle radical changes to page layouts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called COLOR (correct locator recommender) to support repairing broken locators in accordance with software updates. COLOR uses various properties as clues obtained from screens (i.e., attributes, texts, images, and positions). We examined which properties are reliable for recommending locators by examining changes between two release versions of software, and the reliability is adopted as the weight of a property. Our experimental results obtained from four open source web applications show that COLOR can present the correct locator in rst place with a 77%-93% accuracy and is more robust against page layout changes than structure-based approaches. © 2019 Japan Society for Software Science and Technology.

Generating test data for blackbox testing from UML-based web engineering content and presentation models;Software testing is a process that produces and consumes huge amounts of data. Thus, the test data is usually either gathered manually by the testers or randomly generated by tools. The manual method consumes lot of time and highly depends on the testers’ experience while the random approach faces the problem of redundant test data caused by identical use cases. By leveraging the concept of Model-based testing, this paper provides a novel method of testing to save the cost of manual testing and to increase the reliability of the testing processes. In Model-based testing, test cases and test data can be derived from different models. In this paper, we present a technique to generate test data from UML-based Web Engineering (UWE) presentation model for web application testing by using formal specification and Z3 SMT solver. We also build a model-based testing Eclipse Plug-in tool called TESTGER-UWE that generates test data based on the model of UWE for the web application. We evaluate the proposed methods by applying them to generate test data for an Address Book project of UWE. Experimental results show that our proposed methods can reduce the time significantly when generating test data for automation test tools such as Selenium, Katalon, Unit test, etc. © 2019, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.;Huynh Q.-T., Tran D.-D., Nguyen D.-M., Ha N.-H., Bui T.-M.-A., Nguyen P.-L.;2019;Lecture Notes of the Institute for Computer Sciences, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering, LNICST;293;;;207;219;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072900096&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-30149-1_17&partnerID=40&md5=d571336222e75af869534b7c947da258;"Model-based testing; Test case generation; UML-based Web Engineering; Web application testing";"Intelligent systems; Model checking; Testing; Automation tests; Model based testing; Presentation model; Redundant tests; Test case generation; Testing process; Web application testing; Web engineering; Black-box testing";Springer Verlag
jFAT: An automation framework for web application testing;Web technologies have developed rapidly because web application is currently leading the trends of software development. A web-based application is a program that is accessed over a network connection, rather than existing within a device’s memory, hence detecting its failures is different from other software systems. Many approaches and tools have been proposed for web testing, however, introducing new frameworks is still an emerging topic in this field. This paper proposes an automation framework running in Java platform for web testing, called jFAT, which integrates with Selenium and TestNG. The paper also illustrates the use of framework with the Bank application case study. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2019.;Nguyen H.P., Le H.A., Truong N.T.;2019;Lecture Notes of the Institute for Computer Sciences, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering, LNICST;266;;;48;57;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059686934&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-06152-4_5&partnerID=40&md5=6326cf6d30c0e277a4414b264bf7c1e5;"Automation testing; POM; Web applications";"Automation; Software design; User interfaces; Automation testing; Emerging topics; Network connection; Software systems; WEB application; Web application testing; Web technologies; Web-based applications; Application programs";Springer Verlag
Automated testcase generation and prioritization using GA and FRBS;"Software Quality Assurance (SQA) is a process in which the quality of software is assured by adequate software testing techniques that mainly comprise of verification and validation of the software. Software testing is the process of assessing the features of a software item and evaluating it to detect differences between given input and expected output. This process is done during the development process just prior to deployment. The SQA process is usually a manual process due to the diverse and versatile nature of the software products. That means a technique devised to test one type of software may not work that efficiently while testing another kind of software etc. Moreover, it is a time consuming process; according to a survey it consumes almost half of the total development cost and around two third of the total development time. To address the above-mentioned issues, in this research an intelligent toolkit for automated SQA is proposed and compared them with the existing famous tools like Selenium. This research focuses on automated test case/test data generation and prioritization of test cases. For this purpose, Genetic Algorithm is investigated for automatic test case generation and a fuzzy based system is proposed for test case prioritization. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.";Azam M., Atta-ur-Rahman, Sultan K., Dash S., Khan S.N., Khan M.A.A.;2019;Communications in Computer and Information Science;955;;;571;584;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059031933&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-13-3140-4_52&partnerID=40&md5=faefc6a73261dfb3c0b4fce852cea73c;"Automated testing; FRBS; GA; SQA; Testcase generation; Testcase prioritization";"Automation; Computer software selection and evaluation; Gallium; Genetic algorithms; Quality assurance; Surveys; Verification; Automated test-case generations; Automated testing; Automatic test-case generations; FRBS; Prioritization; Software testing techniques; Test case generation; Verification-and-validation; Software testing";Springer Verlag
Optimizing regression test suite reduction;Software reliability is one of the essential features in the system quality. The purpose of the regression testing is to establish quality of the modified software before the software deployment. The main issue in this regression model is how to select a subset of test cases from the large test suite in the modified software version. Conventional regression subset selection models have addressed this issue on a small set of test suites or limited test cases. In this paper, we have studied the background work of different hybrid regression models and its limitations on the standard test suite. For different software applications, the proposed methodology is applied to find various combinations of faults randomly injected into various combinations of code lines as specified. We use selenium builder to test the software applications and run it in junit eclipse IDE to find faults. The tested output is interpreted with java randomly induced faults, and the system of methodology is evaluated in terms of APFD and APFD box plot. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.;Sivaji U., Shraban A., Varalaxmi V., Ashok M., Laxmi L.;2019;Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing;815;;;187;192;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85057139929&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-13-1580-0_18&partnerID=40&md5=8c2d8da043511d645aaaadb5b63837f5;"API programming; Graph models; Regression models; Static suites; Test cases";"Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Artificial intelligence; Regression analysis; Software reliability; Testing; Essential features; Graph model; Regression model; Regression testing; Software applications; Software deployment; Static suites; Test case; Software testing";Springer Verlag

These automation tools works based on screenshots of GUI objects like button, radio button, text box, images, dropdowns etc. In this paper a prototype of automation tool has been developed which can execute the automation scripts much faster than existing tools like Sikuli, which takes much time to run the Automation scripts. The execution time can be reduced by using this proposed tool.

COLOR: Correct Locator Recommender for Broken Test Scripts using Various Clues in Web Application;Test automation tools such as Selenium are commonly used for automating end-To-end tests, but when developers update the software, they often need to modify the test scripts accordingly. However, the costs of modifying these test scripts are a big obstacle to test automation because of the scripts' fragility. In particular, locators in test scripts are prone to change. Some prior methods tried to repair broken locators by using structural clues, but these approaches usually cannot handle radical changes to page layouts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called COLOR (correct locator recommender) to support repairing broken locators in accordance with software updates. COLOR uses various properties as clues obtained from screens (i.e., attributes, texts, images, and positions). We examined which properties are reliable for recommending locators by examining changes between two release versions of software, and the reliability is adopted as the weight of a property. Our experimental results obtained from four open source web applications show that COLOR can present the correct locator in first place with a 77%-93% accuracy and is more robust against page layout changes than structure-based approaches. © 2019 IEEE.;Kirinuki H., Tanno H., Natsukawa K.;2019;SANER 2019 - Proceedings of the 2019 IEEE 26th International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution, and Reengineering;;;8667976;310;320;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064182518&doi=10.1109%2fSANER.2019.8667976&partnerID=40&md5=5f450dfb8e5503f83ab7d7636affed8b;"locator; selenium; software test automation; test script";"Automation; Color; Open source software; Reengineering; Repair; Selenium; Software reliability; Testing; End-to-end tests; locator; Software test automation; Software updates; Structure-based; Test Automation; Test automation tool; Test scripts; Software testing";Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.

Wait wait. No, tell me. Analyzing selenium configuration effects on test flakiness;Flaky tests are a source of frustration and uncertainty for developers. In an educational environment, flaky tests can create doubts related to software behavior and student grades, especially when the grades depend on tests passing. NC State University's junior-level software engineering course models industrial practice through team-based development and testing of new features on a large electronic health record (EHR) system, iTrust2. Students are expected to maintain and supplement an extensive suite of UI tests using Selenium WebDriver. Team builds are run on the course's continuous integration (CI) infrastructure. Students report, and we confirm, that tests that pass on one build will inexplicably fail on the next, impacting productivity and confidence in code quality and the CI system. The goal of this work is to find and fix the sources of flaky tests in iTrust2. We analyze configurations of Selenium using different underlying web browsers and timeout strategies (waits) for both test stability and runtime performance. We also consider underlying hardware and operating systems. Our results show that HtmlUnit with Thread waits provides the lowest number of test failures and best runtime on poor-performing hardware. When given more resources (e.g., more memory and a faster CPU), Google Chrome with Angular waits is less flaky and faster than HtmlUnit, especially if the browser instance is not restarted between tests. The outcomes of this research are a more stable and substantially faster teaching application and a recommendation on how to configure Selenium for applications similar to iTrust2 that run in a CI environment. © 2019 IEEE;Presler-Marshall K., Horton E., Heckman S., Stolee K.T.;2019;Proceedings - 2019 IEEE/ACM 14th International Workshop on Automation of Software Test, AST 2019;;;8821891;7;13;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072896022&doi=10.1109%2fAST.2019.000-1&partnerID=40&md5=21938f499990a4d256497472c830ab57;"Flaky Tests; GUI Tests; Selenium; Software Testing; WebDriver";"Curricula; Selenium; Students; Web browsers; Continuous integrations; Development and testing; Educational environment; Electronic Health Record(EHR) System; Run-time performance; Software engineering course; Teaching applications; WebDriver; Software testing";Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.
Improving the testing efficiency of SELENIUM-based load tests;Web applications must be load tested to analyze their behavior under various load conditions. Typically, these load tests are automated using protocol-level HTTP requests (e.g., using JMETER). However, there are several disadvantages to using protocol-level requests for load tests. For example, protocol-level requests are only partially representative of the true usage of a web application, as the web application is not actually executed in a browser. It can be difficult to abstract complex behavior, such as a login sequence, into requests without executing the application. Browser-based load testing can be used as an alternative to protocol-level requests. Using a browser-based testing framework, such as SELENIUM, tests can be executed more realistically - inside a browser. Unfortunately, because a browser instance must be started to conduct a test, browser-based testing has a high performance overhead which limits its applicability for load tests. In this paper, we propose an approach for reducing the performance overhead of running SELENIUM-based load tests. Our approach shares browser instances between test user instances, thereby reducing the performance overhead that is introduced by launching many browser instances during the execution of a test. Our experimental results show that our approach can significantly increase the number of user instances that can be tested on a test machine without overloading the load driver. Our approach and the experiences that we share in this paper can help software practitioners improve the efficiency of their own SELENIUM-based load tests. © 2019 IEEE;Shariff S.M., Li H., Bezemer C.-P., Hassan A.E., Nguyen T.H.D., Flora P.;2019;Proceedings - 2019 IEEE/ACM 14th International Workshop on Automation of Software Test, AST 2019;;;8821989;14;20;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072882925&doi=10.1109%2fAST.2019.00008&partnerID=40&md5=cadfdda5b6426ff1230f28d7c668ee4e;;"Automation; Cost reduction; Efficiency; HTTP; Hypertext systems; Selenium; Testing; Load condition; Protocol level; Software practitioners; Test machine; Testing efficiency; Testing framework; WEB application; Software testing";Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.
Clustering of web application and testing of asynchronous communication;In model-based testing, testing is done using Input Output Transition System (IOTS) or Finite State Machine (FSM). In synchronous testing, it is easy to know the proper sequence of input output of the system under testing, whereas, in asynchronous communication, it is tough to trace the sequences of inputs and outputs. A web application is an example of asynchronous processing, in which input/ output queue management is a common issue for testing in asynchronous JavaScript and XML user interfaces. This article discusses asynchronous testing of web application by taking a Gmail account as a case study. In this article, the web application is partitioned into clusters by determining logical web pages that implement logical functions. The clusters of page objects are represented using finite state machines. From the FSMs, test scenarios are generated. The size of the test cases covering longer paths is decreased by making clusters of states. The authors conduct a queue analysis using a test architecture to investigate the behavior of the system under testing. Finally, the test cases are generated using the Selenium tool.

Estimating Return on Investment for GUI Test Automation Frameworks;Automated graphical user interface (GUI) tests can reduce manual testing activities and increase test frequency. This motivates the conversion of manual test cases into automated GUI tests. However, it is not clear whether such automation is cost-effective given that GUI automation scripts add to the code base and demand maintenance as a system evolves. In this paper, we introduce a method for estimating maintenance cost and Return on Investment (ROI) for Automated GUI Testing (AGT). The method utilizes the existing source code change history and has the potential to be used for the evaluation of other testing or quality assurance automation technologies. We evaluate the method for a real-world, industrial software system and compare two fundamentally different AGT frameworks, namely Selenium and EyeAutomate, to estimate and compare their ROI. We also report on their defect-finding capabilities and usability. The quantitative data is complemented by interviews with employees at the company the study has been conducted at. The method was successfully applied, and estimated maintenance cost and ROI for both frameworks are reported. Overall, the study supports earlier results showing that implementation time is the leading cost for introducing AGT. The findings further suggest that, while EyeAutomate tests are significantly faster to implement, Selenium tests require more of a programming background but less maintenance. © 2019 IEEE.;Dobslaw F., Feldt R., Michaelsson D., Haar P., De Oliveira Neto F.G., Torkar R.;2019;Proceedings - International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering, ISSRE;2019-October;;8987515;271;282;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081104829&doi=10.1109%2fISSRE.2019.00035&partnerID=40&md5=d49792599106085d24d11620aa7db97a;"EyeAutomate; Graphical User Interface; Selenium; Test Automation; Visual GUI Testing";"Automation; Codes (symbols); Cost effectiveness; Cost estimating; Graphical user interfaces; Maintenance; Profitability; Quality control; Selenium; Testing; EyeAutomate; Graphical user interfaces (GUI); Industrial software; Quality assurance automation; Source code changes; Test Automation; Test automation frameworks; Visual gui testing; Software reliability";IEEE Computer Society
Software transparency acceptance criteria mapping for automated tests [Mapeamento de Critérios de Aceitação de Transparência de Software para Testes Automatizados];Quality requirements include software transparency, which defines how information should be presented and how the software should run and be developed. In order to ensure compliance with these requirements in the Brazilian Public Sector, the Law on Access to Information (LAI) was proposed, which establishes rules for the disclosure of information, demonstrating the need for transparency of processes and information in public organizations. In this context, we propose the creation of abstract acceptance test case templates in order to evaluate the fulfillment of requirements on public organizations' websites. To validate the work, automated tests were developed using Cucumber and Selenium tools. These tests were defined from the abstract templates and addressed sites that meet and do not meet the requirements being tested. The results show that the proposed templates can serve as acceptance tests to be used during the design of government websites. © CIbSE 2020.;Gonçalves B.L., Dos Santos E.C., Vilain P.;2020;23rd Iberoamerican Conference on Software Engineering, CIbSE 2020;;;;;;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096508674&partnerID=40&md5=5d5ca596720f2f99ea8e44c2bc615dcd;"Acceptance Tests; Non-Functional Requirements; Software Transparency; Test Case Templates";"Software design; Software testing; Websites; Acceptance criteria; Automated test; Government websites; Public organizations; Public sector; Quality requirements; Acceptance tests";CIbSE - IberoAmerican Conference on Software Engineering Steering Committee
Codeless web testing using selenium and machine learning;Complexity of web systems lead to development processes always more tough to test. Testing phases are crucial in software and system engineering and are known to be very costly. While automated testing methods appear to take over the role of the human testers, the issues of reliability and the capability of the testing method still need to be solved. In our paper, we focus on the automation of functional tests of websites. A single web page may contain a huge set of important functionalities leading to the execution of critical web service operations. Besides, testing all of these functionalities implemented in a web page service is highly complex. Two current popular research areas for automation web-based testing are Codeless Functional Test Automation and Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI) in test automation. We therefore define and implement a framework to figure out how to automate the web service product under test, the machine can detect or predict the change and adapt those changes to suitable generic test cases. In our work, we examine on Selenium and the benefits of using machine learning in automated web application testing. Copyright © 2020 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Artificial intelligence in automated system for web-interfaces visual testing;In this paper, the authors consider an artificial intelligence technique of providing visual testing, and also the developed system that is integrated into functional automated test suites. Thus carried out monitoring and analyzing of visual changes in the graphical interface of the application under test. A proposed tool is supposed to resolve the existing problems of the traditional snapshot visual testing. Graphical user interface (GUI) testing is a very important testing step for quality control of software applications. The GUI is the central node in the test application, from where all functions are accessed. Thus, it is difficult to thoroughly test programs through their graphical interface, especially because they are designed to work with humans, not machines. In addition, they are inherently non-static interfaces, prone to constant changes caused by functionality upgrades, improved usability, changing requirements or changed contexts. This complicates the development and maintenance of test cases without resorting to time-consuming and costly manual testing. A proposed automated system for web-interfaces visual testing uses computer vision technology as an artificial intelligence technique for visual comparison. A comparative analysis is carried out with the developed interface for testing (in particular, a web page) and the expected mockup with the location of visual elements on the page for example, an interface from the customer). When designing an automated system for web-interfaces visual testing, the programming languages Python, JavaScript, library TensorFlow, testing framework Cypress, and database MySQL were used. © 2020 for this paper by its authors.;Ivanova K., Kondratenko G., Sidenko I., Kondratenko Y.;2020;CEUR Workshop Proceedings;2604;;;1019;1031;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085180679&partnerID=40&md5=97c800d6b45ff1b2639a569fed522d26;"AI algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Automated testing; Computer vision; Digital image; Graphical interface; Pixel comparator; Snapshot; Visual element; Visual testing";"Application programs; Automation; Computational linguistics; Computer testing; Graphical user interfaces; Intelligent systems; Quality control; Software testing; Websites; Application under tests; Artificial intelligence techniques; Comparative analysis; Computer vision technology; Graphical interface; Graphical user interfaces (GUI); Software applications; Visual comparison; Visual languages";CEUR-WS
Automatic Selenium Code Generation for Testing;Developers and product teams are striving to push new features out to customers at a much faster rate and are now realizing the advantages of automation. With the advent of Agile development model, writing automate test codes is now becoming a part of the software development life cycle. Manual testing which is completely done by human hands is costly, time consuming and error prone. However, this transition from manual to automation testing is not so easy especially for the existing manual testers. It is becoming mandatory and very important for them to have programming as a skill. In this paper, we discuss about an application that automatically generates Selenium WebDriver code which can then be used for testing. We present the design, analysis, results and the benefits of using this application to automate test cases. Our application will not only remove programming as a skill for testers but also save time and money for organizations. We input the test case in the form of a simple CSV file in the application which then runs it against a rule-based template engine to produce the desired code. The results highlight the advantage of using this application over manually writing automation test codes. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.;Rathi N., Srivathsav R., Chitlangia R., Pachghare V.K.;2020;Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing;1039;;;194;200;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075600138&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-30465-2_22&partnerID=40&md5=4626608a52d5d35fe22e1e9a340588a0;"Automation; Automation testing; Selenium; Software engineering; Software testing";"Automatic programming; Automation; Control systems; Intelligent computing; Life cycle; Man machine systems; Selenium; Software design; Software engineering; Agile development; Automation testing; Automation tests; Code Generation; Faster rates; Manual testing; Software development life cycle; Template engines; Software testing";Springer
What 5 million job advertisements tell us about testing: A preliminary empirical investigation;Software testing is a crucial part of business success to ensure final product quality. However, little concrete data exists on technical demands about it in the industry, mostly collected through personal opinion surveys on a restricted sample of professionals. In this paper, we used a different approach: we applied content analysis to a set of about five million job advertisements taken from a popular Web job-search engine. The analysis of job advertisements is more promising than surveys because the data are by far more numerous and distributed geographically. The content analysis results revealed four essential findings on the current practice of software testing: a) Companies search for about six times more Coders than Testers, b) Unit testing is the most required skill for Coders while Acceptance testing is the most popular for Testers, c) Automated testing dominates the job advertisement scene compared to Manual testing and, d) the most valuable testing tools and frameworks are Selenium, JUnit, and Cucumber for both Testers and Coders. We believe that these findings (and other related results from the content analysis study) will be useful for professionals, instructors, and researchers dealing with software testing. © 2020 ACM.;Cerioli M., Leotta M., Ricca F.;2020;Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Applied Computing;;;;1586;1594;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083031112&doi=10.1145%2f3341105.3373961&partnerID=40&md5=bd6abed806ac4e28535504f66ead14ef;"Content analysis; Industrial practice; Job advertisements; Software testing; Tools and frameworks";"C (programming language); Search engines; Software quality; Software testing; Surveys; Acceptance testing; Automated testing; Business success; Content analysis; Current practices; Empirical investigation; Opinion surveys; Technical demands; Acceptance tests";Association for Computing Machinery
Web Application Testing with Model Based Testing Method: Case Study;In this study, it was investigated that model based software tests have higher coverage rate and faster test process on the system tested than traditional software tests. Comparisons of these two methods were performed and reported on parameters of code line number, actual error detection rate, test run time parameters. In the model based test method, the tests were developed by using Selenium library with Graph Walker tool. In traditional tests, modular tests were preferred and JUnit and TestNG libraries were used. As a result of the comparisons with the specified parameters, it was concluded that the model based test reduces the burden of test formation as predicted and is fast and inclusive. © 2020 IEEE.;Akpinar P., Aktas M.S., Keles A.B., Balaman Y., Guler Z.O., Kalipsiz O.;2020;2nd International Conference on Electrical, Communication and Computer Engineering, ICECCE 2020;;;9179238;;;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091947994&doi=10.1109%2fICECCE49384.2020.9179238&partnerID=40&md5=c3d4fb7e7c1eb8e011e87886c7028f8a;"automation test; GraphWalker; JUnit; model based testing; TestNG; traditional testing";"Model checking; Testing; Code line; Coverage rate; Model based testing; Model-based OPC; Model-based test; Run time parameters; Test process; Web application testing; Software testing";Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.
A survey of the selenium ecosystem;Selenium is often considered the de-facto standard framework for end-to-end web testing nowadays. It allows practitioners to drive web browsers (such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Opera) in an automated fashion using different language bindings (such as Java, Python, or JavaScript, among others). The term ecosystem, referring to the open-source software domain, includes various components, tools, and other interrelated elements sharing the same technological background. This article presents a descriptive survey aimed to understand how the community uses Selenium and its ecosystem. This survey is structured in seven categories: Selenium foundations, test development, system under test, test infrastructure, other frameworks, community, and personal experience. In light of the current state of Selenium, we analyze future challenges and opportunities around it. © 2020 by the authors.

Selenium based Testing Systems for Analytical Data Generation of Website User Behavior;In recent years, websites have automatically sorted out content suitable for individual users on the website by learning user behavior patterns using AI. Website developers develop a function to generate behavioral data for analysis. The behavior data for analysis records the operation history of all functions such as content expression and button press. However, many consumer websites have a problem of enormous amount of testing due to continuous and frequent development. In this study, we propose a method for efficiently performing browser tests using Selenium by managing the specifications of the behavior data generation function. © 2020 IEEE.;Tanaka T., Niibori H., Shiyingxue L., Nomura S., Nakao T., Tsuda K.;2020;Proceedings - 2020 IEEE 13th International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation Workshops, ICSTW 2020;;;9155736;216;221;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091758259&doi=10.1109%2fICSTW50294.2020.00045&partnerID=40&md5=d9a34e8c2b89515b509d3b0299d3a0b2;"Data Management; Selenium; Test Automation";"Behavioral research; Selenium; Verification; Websites; Analytical data; Behavioral data; Data generation; Operation history; Testing systems; User behavior patterns; User behaviors; Software testing";Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.
AI-driven conversational bot test automation using industry specific data cartridges;The paper describes an in-house accelerator to generate alternate synonymous sentences and similar intent from sample utterances, the generated data can be applied as test input for conversational AI bots (either text or voice-based). Its NLP-driven sentence generator exposes a RESTful service, which can be consumed by automated testing tools/frameworks such as Katalon, Selenium, and so on. The paper presents building an accelerator to quickly teach and test adaptive conversational AI bots. The approach helps to analyze user inputs and extract intent, the bot developer should ensure a variety of possible utterances are coded. In the traditional manual approach, it is difficult to conceive every possible user utterance before deploying the bot and hence the bot has an early failure rate. This may diminish the usefulness of the bot and the users may stop using the same. Here we propose an AI-driven bot test automation approach using a patent-pending in-house accelerator referenced as LemmaCartridge (LC) in this paper. Testing tools or frameworks can consume LC's data cartridge API for testing the bot AUT and analyze the responses using automated tools/frameworks like Katalon, Selenium and so on until the bot demonstrates desired outcomes under the supervised train, test and adaptive repeatable testing methods yielding quality@speed for the single major goal of testing conversational AI bots. An example of a program used in experiment is described and the results obtained, especially train and test state machines, industry-specific data cartridges that enable to unearth errors in the AI bot under test, are presented. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.;Yalla M., Sunil A.;2020;Proceedings - 2020 IEEE/ACM 1st International Conference on Automation of Software Test, AST 2020;;;;105;107;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85093532027&doi=10.1145%2f3387903.3389306&partnerID=40&md5=3deb462a3420a3b33562995f7ce18b3e;"Conversational AI Bot; NLP Automation; Test Data Generation";"Automation; Botnet; Failure analysis; Projectiles; Selenium; Testing; Automated testing tools; Automated tools; Early failure; RESTful Services; State machine; Test Automation; Testing method; Testing tools; Software testing";Association for Computing Machinery
Critical Analysis of Manual Versus Automation Testing;"Software testing examines the gap between system design and software requirements and determines whether the actual output matches the intended result. Software testing can be performed through Manual Testing or Automation Testing. Automation testing involves automated tools, such as Selenium, Webdriver, Appium, with minimal human interference. Manual Testing is done by testers without any tool involvement. In this paper authors have executed both the testing types on a website ""Impressioncart.com""to evaluate and compare the performance of both. It was evident that in most of the cases automation technique out performed manual technique but to say that manual testing should be removed is not justifiable. To test or validate any software application accurately tester need to execute both the techniques due to their advantages and disadvantages. Testing is not only limited to just finding the bug but has a wider scope and is required to be imposed in project from the beginning to retirement. © 2021 IEEE.";Halani K.R., Kavita, Saxena R.;2021;2021 International Conference on Computational Performance Evaluation, ComPE 2021;;;;132;135;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128984240&doi=10.1109%2fComPE53109.2021.9752388&partnerID=40&md5=2dfd16505bb87cb262aedb832ca02e10;"Automation Testing; Manual Testing; Selenium; Software Testing";"Application programs; Automation; Selenium; Automated tools; Automation techniques; Automation testing; Critical analysis; Human interference; Manual techniques; Manual testing; Performance; Software requirements; Software testings; Software testing";Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.
A Literature Review on Automation Testing Using Selenium+Sikuli;Automation testing is a methodology that uses an application to implement the entire life cycle of the software in less time and provides efficiency and effectiveness to the testing software. In automation testing, the tester writes scripts and uses any suitable application software to test the software application. Automation is basically an automated process that is comprised of lots of manual activities. In other words, automation testing uses automation tools like Selenium, Sikuli, Appium, etc., to write test script and execute test cases, with no or minimal manual involvement required while executing an automated test suite. Usually, automation testers write test scripts and test cases using any of the automation tool and then groups test several cases. Here, we will discuss a neat case study explaining the automation testing using a hybrid test script. © 2022 by IGI Global.

A Selenium-based Web Application Automation Test Framework;The quality of Web applications is a matter of great concern to current developers, testers and users. Some existing automated testing methods for Web applications have the problems as low efficiency, cannot be deal with dynamically loaded applications, cannot cope with frequent testing requirements, and so on. This paper designs and implements a Selenium-based Web application automation testing framework to solve the needs of automated testing of complex dynamic Web pages. In the experiment, the proposed framework is evaluated from multiple perspectives such as stability, test efficiency, and comparison with other frameworks. The results show that this framework has high test efficiency and can stably and quickly support automated testing of Web applications. © 2021 IEEE.;Chen G., Chen G., Wu D., Liu Q., Zhang L., Fan X.;2021;Proceedings of 2021 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Information Technology, Big Data and Artificial Intelligence, ICIBA 2021;;;;257;261;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126844422&doi=10.1109%2fICIBA52610.2021.9688190&partnerID=40&md5=893c1caf21cd2e2e838fb6379d3f81a4;"automated test; Selenium; UML; Web application";"Automation; Dynamic loads; Efficiency; Testing; Websites; 'current; Automated test; Automated testing; Automation tests; Test efficiency; Test framework; Testing method; UML; WEB application; Web applications; Selenium";Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.

Our primary purpose is to give a comparative study on open source tools and we choose to compare the most commonly used Selenium with new tools Katalon Studio (KS) and Test project (TP). This research evaluates three tools: Selenium, Katalon Studio Test Project on their test tool characteristics, record and playback efficiency, scripts reusability, ease to learn, cross-platform, data-driven testing, cost, test result report, cross-browser, and team collaboration. The main goal is to help developers and software quality assurance engineers (SQAE) to choose the right tool that reduces manual effort, increasing script usability, reduces cost, and working in team collaboration to give their best to ensure the quality of software. © 2021 IEEE.;Majeed B., Toor S.K., Majeed K., Chaudhary M.N.A.;2021;4th International Conference on Innovative Computing, ICIC 2021;;;;;;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126652705&doi=10.1109%2fICIC53490.2021.9693066&partnerID=40&md5=6a381209aeb094ebb6df4e1c8f82d240;"Evaluation of open source automation tools; Katalon studio; Open source Automation testing tools; Selenium tool; Test project tool";"Automation; Computer software selection and evaluation; Life cycle; Open source software; Open systems; Quality assurance; Reusability; Software design; Software testing; Studios; Testing; Automation testing; Automation tools; Evaluation of open source automation tool; Katalon studio; Open source automation testing tool; Open-source; Project tools; Selenia tool; Test project tool; Test projects; Testing tools; Selenium";Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.
Automating the Bypass of Image-based CAPTCHA and Assessing Security;CAPTCHA also known as Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart is implemented on many websites all round the world to control and limit the entry of bot users in order to tackle issues of unnecessarily generated network traffic resulting in Denial of Service (DoS). A lot of work has been done in breaking text-based CAPTCHA but there is very little research on bypassing an image CAPTCHA. The conventional method used for recognizing image CAPTCHA has been proven to give inefficient results and hence through our paper we have assessed the security of the image-based CAPTCHA by using more efficient techniques and identified the vulnerabilities in it. With the rise of Deep Learning and Computer Vision, we can now bypass image-based CAPTCHAs easily. There have been models developed to test the robustness of text-based CAPTCHA with satisfactory results but not much has been dwelled upon the image section. In this paper, we have built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to bypass the reCaptcha v2 and this is automated with the help of Selenium. The Selenium tool is used to extract the images and pass them to the Deep Learning model. The output generated from the model is used to crack the image CAPTCHA and eventually bypass it. The accuracy of the proposed multi-class CNN model came out to be 92.98 % and hence we were able to bypass the reCaptcha v2. This paper also suggests methods to enhance the security of reCaptcha v2. © 2021 IEEE.;Sukhani K., Sawant S., Maniar S., Pawar R.;2021;2021 12th International Conference on Computing Communication and Networking Technologies, ICCCNT 2021;;;;;;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126258809&doi=10.1109%2fICCCNT51525.2021.9580020&partnerID=40&md5=dea420a512178c62984785768313c241;"Automation; CAPTCHA; Convolutional Neural Network; Deep Learning; Image Classification; reCaptcha v2; Security; Selenium";"Automation; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Denial-of-service attack; Electronic mail filters; Network security; Selenium; CAPTCHAs; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Denial of Service; Image-based; Images classification; Network traffic; Neural network model; Recaptchum v2; Security; Image classification";Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.
Model-based testing leveraged for automated web tests;Agile methods and their practices have fostered the widespread presence of automated test cases. Such test cases have been successfully and extensively adopted to test different software levels, from unit tests (e.g., JUnit) to end-to-end Web Graphical User Interface (GUI) tests (e.g., Selenium Webdriver). While test execution is mostly automated by existing tools, test design remains a manual task. In the pursuit of a more automated test case generation approach, the use of models has been advocated by the model-based testing (MBT) technique. Current MBT approaches assume a top-down workflow in which testers design models, test cases are generated from models, and then scripts are written to automate test execution. Nevertheless, writing automated tests is nowadays a developer’s responsibility and testers face a scenario in which automated tests might be reused to produce new model-based tests. This paper aimed to improve the synergy between existing automated tests and MBT. To do so, we present an approach that infers a model from existing tests, a tester leverages this model to include new tests, and then test code is generated. We analyzed the proposed approach in the context of Web applications with system-level GUI tests that employ the Page Object pattern. For MBT, we adopted event-driven models augmented with parameters and test input data. We evaluated the approach’s applicability with a prototype tool called MoLeWe and an experimental study with nine open-source Web applications. The results provide some evidence that using MoLeWe may help to include new tests faster than manually coding them, while increasing the overall code coverage of the test suite. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.;Mattiello G.R., Endo A.T.;2021;Software Quality Journal;;;;;;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120068446&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-021-09575-w&partnerID=40&md5=b5694b47577ca52b73c2982a79f826eb;"Automated tests; GUI tests; Model-based testing; Page objects; Test case generation";"Automation; Graphical user interfaces; Open source software; Software testing; Testing; Agile methods; Automated test; Graphical user interfaces test; Model based testing; Page object; Test case; Test case generation; Test execution; WEB application; Web applications; Model checking";Springer

A Machine Learning Based Methodology for Web Systems Codeless Testing with Selenium;Web system testing is a crucial software development cycle. However, though there are real needs for testing these complex systems, it often requires specific skills in testing and/or technical programming. Moreover, the lifecycles of web systems are today very dynamic. They are often modified, updated, integrating new data, links, widgets, etc. Therefore, the testing processes and scripts for these systems have to be modified as well which can be very costly in terms of time and resources. Based on that context, this paper aims at reducing these prerequisites and constraints for tester in proposing a codeless testing automation framework. Our approach is based on Selenium and a machine learning technique to propose generic testing scripts that can be automatically tuned to the tested use cases. Experiments are provided leading to relevant results demonstrating the success of our methodology. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;Nguyen P., Maag S.;2021;Communications in Computer and Information Science;1447;;;184;202;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113472488&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-83007-6_9&partnerID=40&md5=29fe4230becc0f9af195c05748de6d96;"Automation testing; Codeless web testing; Machine learning; Selenium; SVM";"Life cycle; Machine learning; Selenium; Software design; Turing machines; Websites; Well testing; Codeless; Machine learning techniques; Software development cycles; Testing automation; Testing process; Web system; Integration testing";Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH

A Systematic Literature Review of Automated Software Testing Tool;Automated software testing has proven its value for software development increasingly over the past few years. Software testing is an important phase in the entire software development process. There are various automated software testing tools are available today, which are used for testing various software applications whether it is desktop-based, mobile application, or a Web-based application. Evaluating a software testing tool is rather a subjective task, depending on the evaluator’s opinions rather than based on the objective approach. For this purpose, we have studied research papers, articles, journals, books, conference papers, few Web sites, etc., related with the study of software testing tools based on which we performed a survey of various automated software testing tools, i.e., Selenium, Watir, QTP, TestComplete, WinRunner, LoadRunner, SilkTest, Apache Jmeter, Wapt, Tellurium, Web Load, NeoLoad, LoadUI, Appvance, rational performance tester, SahiPro, Telerik Test Studio, Ranorex, Storm, Soap UI, TestNG, FitNese, Xebium, etc. The purpose of this research work is to summarize the existing literature and to establish an overview of the existing automated software testing tool to benefit the practice of users and for future research. We are attempting to provide detailed insight into automated software testing tools which can help the tester to choose the tool most suited to test his/her application. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.;Prasad L., Yadav R., Vore N.;2021;Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems;167;;;101;123;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103512120&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-15-9712-1_10&partnerID=40&md5=8b5f69bf6a8d4ee50584fe6f9ed6e509;"Automated; Selenium; Software development; Software testing; Testing tool; Web-based application";;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH
Generating and selecting resilient and maintainable locators for Web automated testing;Web user interface (UI) test automation strategies have been dominated by programmable and record–playback approaches. Of these, record–playback allows creating automation tests easily and reduces the cost of test generation. However, this approach increases the cost of test maintenance due to its unstable generated locators for identifying UI objects during playback. In this paper, we propose a new approach to generating and selecting resilient and maintainable locators. Our approach consists of two parts, a new XPath construction method and selecting the best XPath to locate the target element. Our XPath construction method relies on semantic structures of Web pages to locate the target element using its neighbors. We conducted an experiment on 15 popular websites. The results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-practice/art Selenium IDE and Robula+ in locating target elements by effectively avoiding wrong locators. It also produces more readable XPaths (hence more maintainable tests) than do these approaches. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.;Nguyen V., To T., Diep G.-H.;2021;Software Testing Verification and Reliability;;;;;;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100047951&doi=10.1002%2fstvr.1760&partnerID=40&md5=536cebae36eec2cfbf7ef35cdb8c47cc;"automated testing; web locators; web UI test automation; XPath";"Automation; Semantics; User interfaces; Websites; Automated testing; Automation tests; Construction method; New approaches; Semantic structures; State of the practice; Test Automation; Web user interface; Testing";John Wiley and Sons Ltd
Implementation of Container Based Parallel System for Automation Software Testing;Software quality assurance (QA) is the most important parts of the software development life cycle. Currently, software testing is widely used for automation testing. Two of the popular tools are robot framework and selenium2. Furthermore, software testing has major methods based on Black-box (or functional) testing and White-box (or structural) testing. In order to decrease execution time and improve resource management, the parallel paradigm can be a key concept. Thus, to create the parallel paradigm, we propose the use of selenium-robot-framework Docker container with the parallelization agent the results show that the 4 workers case of parallelization not only decreased to one-Third of the execution time of 1 worker case but also used all physical CPU cores quite similar around 50%. Furthermore, we show how the parallel paradigm using containers and the software automation testing tool beneficial to the significance of resource management. © 2021 IEEE.;Chuchuen Y., Rattanaopas K.;2021;2021 Joint 6th International Conference on Digital Arts, Media and Technology with 4th ECTI Northern Section Conference on Electrical, Electronics, Computer and Telecommunication Engineering, ECTI DAMT and NCON 2021;;;9425738;193;196;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106581981&doi=10.1109%2fECTIDAMTNCON51128.2021.9425738&partnerID=40&md5=b516e9249670f41129cfcc97bb73688c;"Docker; Parallel computational; Robot framework; Selenium";"Arts computing; Automation; Computer software selection and evaluation; Containers; End effectors; Life cycle; Natural resources management; Quality assurance; Resource allocation; Software design; Software quality; Automation software; Automation testing; Black boxes; Parallel system; Parallelizations; Resource management; Software automation; Software development life cycle; Black-box testing";Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.
STILE: A Tool for Parallel Execution of E2E Web Test Scripts;Automated end-to-end (E2E) Web testing relying on frameworks such as Selenium Web Driver is commonly used to assess the quality of web applications. However, the resulting test scripts may require long execution times, due to their interaction with the browser GUI and backend services. To avoid repeated and costly setup of the Web application state, testers tend to build test suites whose test scripts depend on each other (i.e., one test case sets up the application state expected by another test case). In this paper we present Stile, a tool for the parallel execution of Web test scripts that ensures the compliance of all execution schedules with the dependencies among the involved test scripts, while at the same time minimizing the execution time and the computation time required for such parallel execution. Experimental results show that execution times can be approximately halved thanks to Stile. © 2021 IEEE.;Olianas D., Leotta M., Ricca F., Biagiola M., Tonella P.;2021;Proceedings - 2021 IEEE 14th International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation, ICST 2021;;;9438563;460;465;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107918592&doi=10.1109%2fICST49551.2021.00060&partnerID=40&md5=66111794f2669bd461ebd8d5239522e2;"Dependency graph; Docker; End-to-End Testing; Parallel Testing; Selenium; Web Testing";"Testing; Verification; Computation time; End to end; Parallel executions; Test case; Test scripts; WEB application; Web testing; Software testing";Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.
A comparative study of automation testing tools for web applications;In today's world, websites and web applications have become a necessity for all kinds of businesses and commercial enterprises. Software development is an important step of designing the software, ensuring that the designed software fulfills its practical needs and that it is free of bugs and errors. Software testing plays an important role in the software development life cycle because it contributes to the overall quality of the product. This guarantees the consistency and standard of the applications. It is important to be mindful of time and costs when evaluating a program. Therefore most testers have moved from a manual testing to automated testing to reduce time and cost. Then selecting a software-testing tool for automated testing that best fit a project is important yet a challenging task. The aim of this paper is evaluation and comparison of automation testing tools used for web application testing.

Towards automated generation of PO-based WebDriver test suites from Selenium IDE recordings;Modern web applications require long quality assurance sessions to be appreciated by users. Test automation reduces delivery times but requires the development of effective and maintainable test scripts so that the advantages of its use are not lost. The usage of the Page object (PO) pattern has proven to be very effective in GUI testing, however, the manual development of Page objects, a sort of web page facade exposing methods to the test scripts, requires a relevant effort, which is often only repaid during evolution. In this paper, we describe a novel approach, almost totally automated, that takes advantage of the features offered by Selenium IDE for generating more maintainable Selenium WebDriver test scripts and Page objects for web applications. The only manual step required to the tester/developer is to add comments to the Selenese produced by Selenium IDE during registrations through a plugin. The very first estimate we conducted to evaluate our tool-based approach appears to be promising. © 2021 ACM.;Ricca F., Leotta M.;2021;A-TEST 2021 - Proceedings of the 12th International Workshop on Automating TEST Case Design, Selection, and Evaluation, co-located with ESEC/FSE 2021;;;;9;16;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113852593&doi=10.1145%2f3472672.3473953&partnerID=40&md5=7230977a821b8267eaf1c8e632c60e07;"Automated generation; Page Objects; Selenium IDE and WebDriver; Test Automation";"Automation; Integrodifferential equations; Quality assurance; Selenium; Software testing; Websites; Automated generation; Delivery time; GUI testing; Plug-ins; Test Automation; Test scripts; WEB application; Automatic test pattern generation";Association for Computing Machinery, Inc
Combined method of prioritization and automation of software regression testing;This paper describes the proposed method for conducting regression testing of a demo project. The method demonstrates an effective approach to solving regression testing problems by combining change-based prioritization and automating test scripts in whole or in part. The proposed work uses modern automated testing utilities: Selenium WebDriver, Puppeteer and Playwright using the JavaScript programming language. Using automated testing utilities can significantly speed up the time of regression testing. Research methods are based on the development of scripts for the main functionality and end-to-end scripts of the demo project.

An Enhanced Parallel Automation Testing Architecture for Test Case Execution;Customer requests for incorporating complicated business logic into software applications are common. As a result, as business requirements expand, the demand on the testing team to deliver a high-quality product in a short amount of time grows. Software testing guarantees that customers receive high-quality software. Manual testing becomes difficult since it is time-consuming. Besides, its cost rises as test suite sizes grow. In addition, human mistakes can slip into a system, resulting in losses for the company. Therefore, automation testing is best suited in situations when requirements change frequently, and a large volume of regression testing is required. Automation testing enhances accuracy while also saving the tester's time and the organization's money. The aim of this work is to propose an improved parallel automation testing architecture to significantly decrease testing time. The main problem with parallel testing is the existence of idle nodes that causes an increase in execution time. The proposed architecture solved this problem by running test cases in parallel using Selenium, Docker containers and implementing a dispatcher to ease and faster the process of distributing test cases between the network's nodes. As a result, the proposed architecture decreases testing process time, and no idle nodes exists anymore. © 2022 IEEE.;Nagy S.M., Maghawry H.A., Badr N.L.;2022;5th International Conference on Computing and Informatics, ICCI 2022;;;;369;373;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129435579&doi=10.1109%2fICCI54321.2022.9756109&partnerID=40&md5=b240b4bf6149771c6952475908fe68bd;"automation testing; docker; parallel test case execution; regression testing; selenium";"Application programs; Automation; Computation theory; Network architecture; Parallel architectures; Selenium; Testing; Automation testing; Business logic; Business requirement; Docker; Parallel test; Parallel test case execution; Proposed architectures; Regression testing; Software applications; Test case; Software testing";Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.
Software Test Automation Using Selenium and Machine Learning;Software testing has always been a crucial job in accomplishing and assessing the quality standards of a software product. Software testing is done to confirm the developed software product does what it is expected to do. However, testing is expensive in terms of time, effort, and is quite complicated. Studies report that software testing alone is responsible for almost half of the total budget incurred in software development. Additionally, manual testing is more prone to bugs and creating accurate and reliable software is an open issue. Specialists and experts have been exploring more effective and successful automation techniques for testing to deal with this issue. This paper is an endeavor to review the cutting edge of how machine learning and artificial intelligence have been figured out to automate and streamline software testing processes. It also provides an insight mapping of the research into these fields. Furthermore, a practical study on testing web applications is performed using selenium. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.;Jha N., Popli R., Chakraborty S., Kumar P.;2022;Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems;329;;;419;429;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123297829&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-16-6246-1_35&partnerID=40&md5=3761bb2937361fe54c2d553c80ef8385;"Artificial intelligence; Machine learning; Software testing; Test automation";;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH
Selenium-Jupiter: A JUnit 5 extension for Selenium WebDriver;Selenium WebDriver is a library that allows controlling web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, etc.) programmatically. It provides a cross-browser programming interface in several languages used primarily to implement end-to-end tests for web applications. JUnit is a popular unit testing framework for Java. Its latest version (i.e., JUnit 5) provides a programming and extension model called Jupiter. This paper presents Selenium-Jupiter, an open-source JUnit 5 extension for Selenium WebDriver. Selenium-Jupiter aims to ease the development of Selenium WebDriver tests thanks to an automated driver management process implemented in conjunction with the Jupiter parameter resolution mechanism. Moreover, Selenium-Jupiter provides seamless integration with Docker, allowing the use of different web browsers in Docker containers out of the box. This feature enables cross-browser testing, load testing, and troubleshooting (e.g., configurable session recordings). This paper presents an example case in which Selenium-Jupiter is used to evaluate the performance of video conferencing systems based on WebRTC. This example case shows that Selenium-Jupiter can build and maintain the required infrastructure for complex tests effortlessly. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.;García B., Delgado Kloos C., Alario-Hoyos C., Munoz-Organero M.;2022;Journal of Systems and Software;189;;111298;;;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126631924&doi=10.1016%2fj.jss.2022.111298&partnerID=40&md5=c12a6e93a89f7542efa5767b00d665fc;"Automated testing tools; Browser automation; Docker; End-to-end testing; JUnit; Selenium WebDriver";"Automation; Load testing; Open source software; Selenium; Web browsers; Automated testing tools; Browser automation; Docker; End to end; End-to-end testing; Firefox; Junit; Jupiters; Programming interface; Selenia webdriver; Video conferencing";Elsevier Inc.

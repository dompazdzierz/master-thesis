"A survey of software testing practices in Canada,""Software testing is an important activity in the software development life-cycle. In an earlier study in 2009, we reported the results of a regional survey of software testing practices among practitioners in the Canadian province of Alberta. To get a larger nationwide view on this topic (across Canada), we conducted a newer survey with a revised list of questions in 2010. Compared to our previous Alberta-wide survey (53 software practitioners), the nation-wide survey had larger number of participants (246 practitioners). We report the survey design, execution and results in this article. The survey results reveal important and interesting findings about software testing practices in Canada. Whenever possible, we also compare the results of this survey to other similar studies, such as the ones conducted in the US, Sweden and Australia, and also two previous Alberta-wide surveys, including our 2009 survey. The results of our survey will be of interest to testing professionals both in Canada and world-wide. It will also benefit researchers in observing the latest trends in software testing industry identifying the areas of strength and weakness, which would then hopefully encourage further industry-academia collaborations in this area. Among the findings are the followings: (1) the importance of testing-related training is increasing, (2) functional and unit testing are two common test types that receive the most attention and efforts spent on them, (3) usage of the mutation testing approach is getting attention among Canadian firms, (4) traditional Test-last Development (TLD) style is still dominating and a few companies are attempting the new development approaches such as Test-Driven Development (TDD), and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), (5) in terms of the most popular test tools, NUnit and Web application testing tools overtook JUnit and IBM Rational tools, (6) most Canadian companies use a combination of two coverage metrics: decision (branch) and condition coverage, (7) number of passing user acceptance tests and number of defects found per day (week or month) are regarded as the most important quality assurance metrics and decision factors to release, (8) in most Canadian companies, testers are out-numbered by developers, with ratios ranging from 1:2 to 1:5, (9) the majority of Canadian firms spent less than 40% of their efforts (budget and time) on testing during development, and (10) more than 70% of respondents participated in online discussion forums related to testing on a regular basis. © 2012 Elsevier Inc."",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84875265017&doi=10.1016%2fj.jss.2012.12.051&partnerID=40&md5=f4f6e01e3cf6ff84d6cf9d86aaa265cc,,""Garousi V., Zhi J."",2013,Journal of Systems and Software,86,5,,1354,1376,,Canada"; Industry practices; Software testing; Survey,Acceptance tests; Budget control; Computer programming; Life cycle; Quality assurance; Software design; Surveying; Surveys; Canada; Development approach; Industry practices; Online discussion forums; Software development life cycle; Software practitioners; Test driven development; Web application testing; Software testing,Elsevier Inc.
"Design of unit testing using xUnit.net,""This paper presents an in-depth study of designing, implementing and executing unit test cases using the xUnit.net testing tool in general and in the context of the TeleMedicine Cluster System project within the ICT Design subject delivered at UTS, Australia. The case studies are based on the utilisation of the tool in Visual Basic 2012 using the.NET framework for C#. The paper elucidates on how and why the xUnit framework can be applied in the context of the TMC system, and how it can be tailored to meet the testing ad integration needs of the delivery of TMC system. © 2014 IEEE."",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84943311889&doi=10.1109%2fITHET.2014.7155685&partnerID=40&md5=214b6d850168cfb89ce7748523154a86,"""",""Chaczko Z., Braun R., Carrion L., Dagher J."",2014,ITHET 2014 - 13th International Conference on Information Technology Based Higher Education and Training,,,7155685,,,,Automated Testing"; Software Development Process; Unit Testing,Education; Engineering education; Software design; Software engineering; Software testing; Automated testing; Case-studies; Cluster systems; In-depth study; Software development process; Testing tools; Unit testing; Unit tests; Integration testing,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;;;
"Automating Web Application Testing from the Ground Up: Experiences and Lessons Learned in an Industrial Setting,""Automating web application testing is a very tricky process due to inherent complexity, dynamic behavior(s) in web pages, differences in the way browsers render the same content (especially on different form factors), and so on. Yet manual testing is not a practical option, and such automation is a must in the interests of effectiveness and efficiency, because of the large number of browsers/devices that users can choose from, and also given the rapid software development cycles of today. This paper discusses our efforts at Varidesk to automate web tests against our main website-which offers many features and content, but is also a true eCommerce site where users from around the globe can purchase a very broad variety of active workspace solutions that we offer. Our solution was developed in-house, from the ground up, and leveraged and extended freely available automation and test libraries such as Selenium WebDriver and NUnit respectively. We talk about the challenges we faced and how we overcame them, as well as provide technical insights on real-world concerns such as managing test brittleness, and integrating the web tests into an existing Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. Part of the novelty of this paper is that we are also transparent on the rationale behind our decision to build versus buy, and how we managed resources, especially in terms of cost. We also present lessons learned, and encouraged by the success that we have observed, hope that the results will be beneficial to academia and practitioners alike. © 2018 IEEE."",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048453978&doi=10.1109%2fICST.2018.00042&partnerID=40&md5=ec31fbfde0ac7dd7dbeed5636d1bc145,,""Debroy V., Brimble L., Yost M., Erry A."",2018,""Proceedings - 2018 IEEE 11th International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation, ICST 2018"",,,,354,362,,automation"; industry experience; web application testing; web testing,Automation; Digital libraries; Fracture mechanics; Software design; Verification; Websites; Continuous integrations; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Industrial settings; Industry experience; Inherent complexity; Software development cycles; Web application testing; Web testing; Software testing,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;;
